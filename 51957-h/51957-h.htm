      A LETTER OF DEDICATION
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO
    </h3>
    <h3>
      FRANK NELSON DOUBLEDAY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dear Effendi:
    </p>
    <p>
      I take the liberty of dedicating these little stories to you, with
      affection and respect. They have all grown, in one mood or another, out of
      the various life of Grub Street, suggested by adventures with publishers,
      booksellers, magazine editors, newspaper men, theatrical producers,
      commuters, and poets major and minor. If they have any appeal at all, it
      must be as an honest (though perhaps sometimes too jocular) picture of the
      excitements that gratify the career of young men who embark upon the ocean
      of ink, and (let us not forget) those much-enduring Titanias who consent
      to share their vicissitudes. You have been the best of friends and
      counsellors to many such young men, and I assure you that they look back
      upon the time spent under your shrewd and humorous magistracy with special
      loyalty and regard. You will understand that in these irresponsible
      stories no personal identifications are to be presumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think you remember&mdash;I know you do, because you have often
      charitably chuckled over the incident&mdash;that rather too eager young
      man who came to call on you one day in September, 1913, saying that he
      simply must have a job. And how you, in your inimitable way, said &ldquo;Well,
      what kind of a job would you like best to have around this place?&rdquo; And he
      cried &ldquo;Yours!&rdquo; And you justly punctured the creature by saying &ldquo;All right,
      go to work and get it.&rdquo; (There was more youthful palpitation than intended
      impertinence in the young man's outcry, so he has assured me.) And then,
      still tremulous with ambition, this misguided freshman pulled out of his
      pocket a bulky memorandum on which he had inscribed his pet scheme for the
      regeneration and stimulus of the publishing business, and laid it before
      you. How hospitably you considered his programme, and how tenderly you
      must have smiled, inwardly, at his odd mixture of earnestness and
      excitement! At any rate, you set him to work that afternoon, with the
      assurance that he might have your job as soon as he could qualify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he did not get it; nor will he ever, for he knows (by this time)
      what a rare complex of instincts and sagacities is needed in the head of a
      great publishing house; and his own ambition has proved to be a little
      different. But he can never be enough grateful for the patience and
      humorous tolerance with which you brooded upon his various antics,
      condoned his many absurdities, welcomed and encouraged his enthusiasms. In
      nearly four years in your &ldquo;shop&rdquo; he learned (so he insists) more than any
      college could ever teach: and how much he had to unlearn, too! And the
      surprising part of it was, it was all such extraordinarily good fun. The
      greatest moments of all, I suppose, were when this young man was invited
      by one of your partners (on occasions that seemed so interminably far
      apart!) to &ldquo;walk in the garden,&rdquo; that being the cheerful tradition of the
      Country Life Press. There, after some embarrassing chat about the peonies
      and the sun dial, the victim meanwhile groaning to know whether it was,
      this time, hail or farewell, there would come tidings of one of those
      five-dollar raises that were so hotly desiderated. That paternal function
      (so this young man and his fellow small fry observed) was rightly a little
      beneath the dignity of the Effendi: you, they noted, only walked in the
      garden with paper merchants and people like Booth Tarkington and Ellen
      Glasgow and good Mr. Grosset of Grosset and Dunlap!
    </p>
    <p>
      Many young men (O Effendi), from Frank Norris down, have found your house
      a wonderful training-school for writers and publishers and booksellers.
      There are great names, of permanent honour in literature, that owe much to
      your wisdom and patience. But among all those who know you in your trebled
      capacity as employer, publisher, and friend, there is none who has more
      reason to be grateful, or who has done less to deserve it, than the young
      man I have described. And so you will forgive him if he thus publicly and
      selfishly pleases himself by trying to express his sense of gratitude, and
      signs himself
    </p>
    <p>
      Faithfully yours
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher Morley.

      THE PRIZE PACKAGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ESTER VALIANT came
      back from Oxford with the degree of B. Litt., some unpaid tailors' bills,
      and the conviction that the world owed him a living because he had been
      suffered within the sacred precincts of Balliol College for three years. A
      Rhodes scholarship is one of the most bounteous gifts the world holds for
      a young man; but in Lester's case Oxford piled upon Harvard left him with
      a perilous lot to unlearn. You can tell a lot about a man when you know
      what he is proud of; and Lester was really proud of having worn a wrist
      watch and a dinner jacket with blue silk lapels three or four years before
      they became habitual in the region of Herald Square. But let us be just:
      he was also proud of his first editions of Conrad and George Moore; for he
      was much afflicted with literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lester originated in the yonder part of Indiana, but when he returned from
      Oxford he made up his mind to live in New York. He felt it appropriate
      that he should be connected in some way with the production of literature,
      and after hiring a bedroom on the fourth floor of an old house on Madison
      Avenue, where two friends of his were living, he set out to visit the
      publishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a third-rate club in London called the Litterateurs' Club. A few
      years ago it was in urgent need of funds, and a brilliant idea struck the
      managing committee. Every writer listed in the American &ldquo;Who's Who&rdquo; was
      circularized and received a very flattering letter saying that, owing to
      the distinction of his contributions to contemporary letters, the
      Litterateurs' Club of London would be very much pleased to welcome him as
      a member, upon a nominal payment of five guineas. About seven hundred
      guileless persons complied, and transatlantic travel became appreciably
      denser on account of these men of letters crossing to England to revel in
      their importance as members of a club of which no one in London has ever
      heard. And by some fluke the managing committee had got hold of the name
      of Lester Valiant, then at Oxford&mdash;perhaps because he had once
      published a story in the <i>Cantharides Magazine</i>. Probably they bought
      a mailing list from some firm in Tottenham Court Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil Rhodes's executors paid his five guineas, and he had his cards
      engraved:
    </p>
    <h3>
      LESTER G. P. VALIANT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Litterateurs' Club, London
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of these pasteboards brought him ready entrée in the offices of
      New York publishers. If he had not been so eager to impress the gentlemen
      he interviewed with his literary connoisseurship, undoubtedly he would
      have landed a job much sooner. But publishers are justly suspicious of
      anything that savours of literature, and Lester's innocent allusions to
      George Moore and Chelsea did much to alarm them. At length, however, Mr.
      Arundel, the president of the Arundel Company, took pity on the young man
      and gave him a desk in his editorial department and fifteen dollars a
      week. Mr. Arundel had once walked through the quadrangle of Balliol, and
      he was not disposed to be too severe toward Lester's naïve mannerisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his amazement and dismay, Lester found his occupation not even faintly
      flavoured with literature. He was set to work writing press notes about
      authors of whom he had never heard at Oxford and whose books he soon
      discovered to be amateurish or worse. He had been nourishing himself upon
      the English conception of a publisher's office: a quaint, dingy rookery
      somewhere in Clifford's Inn, where gentlemen in spats and monocles
      discuss, over cups of tea and platters of anchovy toast, realism and the
      latest freak of the Spasmodists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arundel office was a wilderness of light walnut desks and filing
      cases, throbbing with typewriters, adding machines, and hoarse cries from
      the shipping room at the rear. Here sat Lester, gloomily writing blurbs
      for literary editors, and wondering how long it would be before he would
      earn forty dollars a week. He reckoned that was what one ought to get
      before incurring matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all young men of twenty-three, Lester thought a good deal about
      marriage, although he had not yet chosen his quarry. The feeling that he
      could marry almost anybody was delicious to him. But this heavenly
      eclecticism endures such a short time! For youth abhors generalities and
      seeks the concrete instance. Also, much reading of George Moore sets the
      mind brooding on these things. Lester used to stroll in Madison Square at
      dusk before going back to his room, and his visions were often of a
      dark-panelled apartment in the Gramercy Park neighbourhood where an open
      fire would be burning and someone sitting in silk stockings to endear him
      as he returned from the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arrival caused something of an upheaval in the placid breasts of the
      two old college friends whose sitting room he shared on Madison Avenue.
      They were sturdy and steady creatures, more familiar with Edward Earle
      Purinton and Orison Swett Marden than with Swinburne and Crackanthorpe and
      Mallarmé. To his secret annoyance, Lester learned that both Jack Hulbert
      and Harry Hanover were earning more than thirty dollars a week, and he
      even had an uneasy suspicion that they were saving some of it. When he
      spoke about Beardsley or Will Rothenstein or the Grafton Galleries they
      were apt to turn the talk upon Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker. When he showed
      them his greatest treasure, a plaster life mask of himself that a
      sculpturing friend in Chelsea had made, they were frankly ribald. Jack was
      in the circulation department of a popular magazine, and Harry performed
      some unexplained tasks in the office of a tea importer. Lester was fond of
      them both, but it seemed to him a bitter travesty that these simple-minded
      Philistines should possess so much higher earning power than he. So he
      thought of taking a garret in Greenwich Village, but in the Madison Avenue
      house he was sharing a big sitting room at little expense. So he spread
      his books about, hung up his framed letter from Przybyszewski, put his
      hammered brass tea caddy on the reading table, and made the best of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even on fifteen dollars a week a young man may have a very amusing time in
      New York. For his room and breakfast Lester paid six dollars a week; for
      his other meals he used to hunt out the little table-d'hôte restaurants of
      which there are so many in the crosstown streets between the Avenue and
      Broadway. To come in from the snowy street on a winter evening, sit down
      to a tureen of Moretti's hot minestrone, open a new packet of ten-cent
      cigarettes, and prop up a copy of the <i>Oblique Review</i> against the
      cruet stand, seemed to Lester the prismatic fringe of all that was <i>je
      ne sais quoi</i> and <i>ne plus ultra</i>. The dandruffians in the little
      orchestra under the stairs would hammer out some braying operatic strains,
      and Lester would lean back in a swirl of acrid tobacco smoke and survey
      his surroundings with great content.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while he was conjugating the verb <i>to live</i> in this manner,
      and sowing (as someone has said) a notable crop of wild table d'hôtes,
      that he first realized the importance of Pearl Denver. Miss Pearl was Mr.
      Arundel's personal stenographer, a young woman remarkable in her
      profession by the fact that she never exposed the details of her camisole
      to the public gaze; also when the boss dictated she was able to rescue his
      subordinate clauses from the airy vacancy in which they hung suspended,
      and hook them up into new sentences capable of grammatical analysis. As a
      stenog she was distinctly above par, but not above parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lester, of course, had a speaking acquaintance with Miss Denver, but her
      existence had never really penetrated the warm aura of egocentric thoughts
      that enhaloed him. He knew her simply as one of the contingents of the
      office; and the office had proved a great disappointment to him. Not one
      of the &ldquo;firm&rdquo; (he called them &ldquo;directors&rdquo;) wore spats; not one of them had
      shown the faintest interest in his suggestion that they publish a volume
      of Clara Tice's drawings. Lester must be pardoned for having dismissed
      Miss Denver, if he had thought of her at all, as not <i>generis.</i>

    <p>
      We now proceed more rapidly. Entering the hallway of Moretti's on
      Thirty-fifth Street, about half past one cocktail of a winter evening, he
      found the cramped vestibule crowded by several persons taking off their
      wraps. A copy of the <i>Oblique Review</i>, unmistakable in its
      garlic-green cover, fell at his feet. Thinking it his own, he picked it up
      and was about to pocket it when a red tarn o'shan-ter in front of him
      turned round. He saw the bobbed brown hair and gray eyes of Miss Denver.
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Valiant, what are you doing with my magazine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;why&mdash;I beg your pardon! I thought it was mine! I'm awfully
      sorry!&rdquo; He was keenly embarrassed, and pulled his own copy out of his
      overcoat pocket as an evidence of good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;I don't wonder you made the mistake,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Probably
      you thought you were the only person in New York reading the Oblique!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt the alarm that every shy or cautious youth experiences in the
      presence of beauty, and, with a mumbled apology, fled hastily to a little
      table in a corner. There, pretending to read some preposterous farrago of
      free verse, he watched Miss Denver meet another girl who was evidently
      waiting for her. The two chattered with such abandon, smoked so many
      cigarettes, and seemed so thoroughly at home that Lester envied them their
      savoir. Manoeuvring his spaghetti and parmesan, his gaze passed as direct
      as the cartoonist's dotted line to the charming contour of the
      stenographer's cheek and neck. His equanimity was quite overset. Never
      before had he gazed with seeing eye upon the demure creature sorting out
      Mr. Arundel's mind into paragraphs. Human nature is what it is; let
      Lester's first thought be confessed: &ldquo;I wonder if she knows what my salary
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, after smoking many cigarettes and skimming over the <i>Oblique
      Review</i>, Lester felt it was his move. He walked down the room, looking
      at his wrist watch with a slight frown as he passed her table. At the door
      he saw by the reflection in a mirror that she had not even looked up. He
      hurried back to Madison Avenue, pausing to sniff the crystal frosty air.
      At the corner of Fifth he stood for a moment, inhaling the miraculous
      clearness of the night and pondering on the relative values of free verse
      and ordered rhythms as modes of self-expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of a certain bumptiousness among males, Lester was painfully shy
      with nubile women, and it was several days before he had opportunity for
      further speech with Miss Denver. Moretti's is a fifty-cent table d'hôte,
      and his regimen was calculated on a forty-cent limit for dinner; but after
      this meeting with the <i>Oblique Review's</i> fairest <i>abonnée</i> he
      haunted the place for some evenings. Then one day, taking in some copy for
      a book jacket to be approved by the sales manager, he encountered Miss
      Denver in the sample room. During working hours she was &ldquo;strictly
      business,&rdquo; and he admired the trim white blouse, the satin-smooth neck,
      and the small, capable hands jotting pothooks in her notebook as she took
      a long telephone call. She put down the receiver, and smiled pleasantly at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you go to Moretti's any more?&rdquo; he asked, and then regretted the
      brusqueness of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Usually when I buy the <i>Oblique</i> I go to a
      Hartford Lunch. I can sit there as long as I want and read, with doughnuts
      and coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester had a curious feeling of oscillation somewhere to the left of his
      middle waistcoat button. As the little girl said on the Coney Island
      switchback, he felt as though he had freckles on his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come to Moretti's with me some night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd love to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must hurry now. Mr. Arundel's waiting for this
      phone call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later in the day, after a good deal of heartburning, Lester
      called her up from his desk. &ldquo;How about to-morrow night?&rdquo; he said, and she
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Coursing back to his chamber the next evening, Lester was a little worried
      about the ceremonial demanded by the occasion. Should he put on white
      linen and a dinner jacket, becoming the conquering male of the upper
      classes? But the recollection of the <i>Oblique Review</i> suggested that
      a touch of négligée would be more appropriate. A clean, soft collar and a
      bow tie of lavender silk were his concessions to unconvention. He was
      about to scrub out a minute soup stain on the breast of his coat, but
      concluded that as a badge of graceful carelessness this might remain. At a
      tobacconist's he bought a package of cheap Russian cigarettes, such as he
      imagined a Bolshevik might smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she came, tripping along the street, with something of the quick,
      alcaic motion of an Undersmith on high. He waved gayly. She depressed her
      shift key and reversed the ribbon. He double-spaced, and they entered the
      restaurant together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lester felt an intellectual tremor as they sat down at a corner table.
      Never had his mind seemed so relentlessly clear, so keen to leap upon the
      problems of life and tessellate them. It was as though all his past
      experience had cumulated and led up to this peak of existence. &ldquo;Now for a
      close analysis of Female Mind,&rdquo; was his secret thought as he settled in
      his chair. He felt almost sorry for this gay, defenceless little shred of
      humanity who had cast herself under his domineering gaze. A masculine
      awareness of size and power filled him. And yet&mdash;she seemed quite
      unterrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they began on the antipasto he thought to himself: &ldquo;I must start very
      gently. Women like men to veil their power.&rdquo; So he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was funny, my picking up your magazine the other night, wasn't it?
      You know I thought it was my copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the dear old <i>Oblique!</i> Isn't it a scream? I read myself to
      sleep with it every night. We'll have to make the most of it while we can,
      because Mr. Arundel says it can't pay its paper bill much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This irreverence rather startled Lester, who was writing an article &ldquo;On
      the Art of Clara Tice&rdquo; which he had been hoping the Oblique would buy. In
      fact, he was startled quite out of the careful conversational paradigm he
      had planned. He found himself getting a little ahead of his barrage. &ldquo;Does
      Mr. Arundel read it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Heavens, no!&rdquo; cried Miss Denver, and
      effervesced with laughter. &ldquo;He would rather face a firing squad than read
      that kind of stuff. But he has an interest in the concern that supplies
      their paper.&rdquo; The matter of paper had never occurred to Lester before. Of
      course he knew a magazine had to have something to print on, but he had
      never thought of the editors of a radical review being embarrassed by such
      a paltry consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Arundel literary?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denver found this very whimsical. &ldquo;Say, are you kidding me?&rdquo; she
      said, with tilted eyebrows. &ldquo;The chief says literature is the curse of the
      publishing business. Every time somebody puts over some highbrow stuff on
      him we lose money on it. The only kind of literature that gets under his
      ribs is reports from the sales department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very Philistine, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure it is, but it puts the frogs in the pay envelopes, so what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should expect the head of a big publishing house to be at least
      interested in some form of literary expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should worry! That's what we hires for. Besides he <i>has</i> a
      literary passion, too&mdash;Walt Mason. He thinks Walt is the greatest
      poet in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter Mason?&rdquo; murmured Lester. &ldquo;I don't think I know his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't Walt made Oxford yet?&rdquo; asked Miss Denver. &ldquo;He writes the prose
      poems in the evening papers, syndicate stuff, you know. Printed to look
      like prose, just the opposite of the free-verse gag.&rdquo; She smiled
      reminiscently, and quoted:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>When I am as dry as a fish up a tree, then I to the hydrant repair, and
      fill myself up, without ticket or fee, with the water that's eddying
      there. I drink all I want&mdash;half a gallon or more&mdash;and then I lie
      down on my couch; when I rise in the morning my head isn't sore and I
      don't wear a dark brindle grouch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any free-verse stuff that can cover that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lester was somewhat disconcerted. His assessment of Female Mind did not
      seem to be proceeding methodically. He played for time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you enjoyed the <i>Oblique</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a joke, yes: I laugh myself giddy over it. But I know darn well that
      kind of junk won't last. By and by the ghost'll quit putting up and the
      editors will get jobs as ticket choppers. I guess I'm a Philistine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this deliciously impudent creature beaming at him, Lester felt
      himself cursedly at a disadvantage. Neither Harvard nor Balliol had
      informed him about this Walter Mason, and though he had seven hundred
      quips and anecdotes indexed in a scrapbook marked <i>Jocoseria</i>, none
      of them seemed to bubble up just now. Darn the girl, her mind wouldn't
      stand still long enough for him to take its temperature. It was like
      trying to write captions for the movies while the film was running. He
      blew a cloud of blue Russian vapour across the board, and smiled at her in
      a tolerant, <i>veni-vidi-Bolsheviki</i> kind of way. Behind his forehead
      he was fighting desperately to catch up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they wrestled with the spaghetti he remembered that someone had told
      him that publishers usually depend on the literary judgment of their
      wives. Perhaps that was the case with Mr. Arundel? But Miss Denver laughed
      aloud at the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong again!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He's not married. Petunia Veal, the author of
      'Sveltschmerz,' has been angling for him for years, and lots of other lady
      authors, too. He's so sentimental, he's escaped 'em all so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bubbled and chuckled and gurgled her way through the rest of Moretti's
      menu, amazing him more and more by the spontaneity, sophistication, and
      charm of her wit. He escorted her home, and then stood under a lamp-post
      for three minutes removing the soup stain with a handkerchief. &ldquo;She's
      immense!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Why she's&mdash;she's a poem by William
      Butler Yeats!&rdquo; As an afterthought, he made a mental memorandum to visit
      the library and look up the work of Walter Mason.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later Mr. Arundel sent for Lester, who hurried to the private
      office with visions of a raise in salary. The president was sitting at his
      desk turning over some papers; he motioned Lester to a chair and seemed
      curiously loath to begin conversation. At last he turned, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Valiant, your life at Oxford did a great deal to mitigate your
      literary sensibilities?&rdquo; Lester hardly knew what to say, and murmured some
      meaningless syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that your abilities can be of very great service to us,&rdquo;
       continued Mr. Arundel, &ldquo;and as an evidence of that I am asking the cashier
      to raise your salary five dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester bowed gently; he was not capable of articulate speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you a rather delicate question,&rdquo; pursued the president, who
      seemed as much embarrassed as his visitor. &ldquo;Do you ever write poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester's voice was amazingly hoarse and choky, but in a spasm of
      puzzlement and gratification he ejaculated: &ldquo;Sometimes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I really mean,&rdquo; said Mr. Arundel, &ldquo;is this: do you ever write verses
      of a sentimental nature&mdash;hum&mdash;what might be called endearments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man sat speechless in surprise and embarrassment. As a matter of
      fact, he had been trolling some amatory staves in secret, in honour of
      Miss Denver; and he imagined they had come in some way under his
      employer's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not be alarmed,&rdquo; said Mr. Arundel, seeing his discomfiture.
      &ldquo;This is purely a matter of business. As it happens, I have a need for
      some poems of an intimately sentimental character, and, being totally
      unfitted to produce them myself, I wondered if you would sell me some? I
      would be glad to pay market rates for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Lester could do no more than bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to be frank,&rdquo; said Mr. Arundel, &ldquo;and I must beg you to keep
      this matter absolutely confidential. I have your word of honour in that
      regard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; said Lester, quite vanquished by amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president's sense of humour seemed to have mastered his diffidence. A
      quaint smile lurked behind the furrows that years of royalties had carved
      on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to do some wooing in rhyme; and I want you to turn out some verses
      for me of a superlatively lyric sort, it being understood that I purchase
      all rights in these poems, including that of authorship. Would you be
      willing to do me half a dozen, at say ten dollars each?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester, although staggered by the proposal, was still able to multiply six
      by ten, and his answer was affirmative and speedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to give you any specifications as to the object of your
      vicarious amour,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;It is a lady, of course; young and
      fair. How soon can you despoil the English language of half a dozen songs
      of passion worthy of the best Oxford traditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack and Harry found Lester good company that evening. When they got back
      to the sitting room on Madison Avenue he was lying on a couch, nursing a
      large calabash and contemplating the ceiling with dreamy brow. As they
      entered, stripping off their overcoats and chucking the night extras
      across the room at him, he smiled the rich, tolerant smile of Alexander at
      the Macedon polo grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lester,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;why the Cheshire-cat grin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've sold sixty dollars' worth of verse,&rdquo; said Lester, benignly; &ldquo;also
      I've had a raise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Think how many starving cubists you could endow on
      that! There'll be a riot in Greenwich Village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity the poor bartenders on a night like this!&rdquo; cried Jack. Then they
      went to Browne's chop-house for dinner. After a three-finger steak and
      several beakers of dog's nose, Lester was readily persuaded to enounce the
      first number of his sonnet sequence, which had accreted or (as its author
      expressed it) nucleolated, while he was walking home from the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sonnet, in the Petrarchan mode, item No. 1,&rdquo; he proclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Upon a trellis, bending toward the south,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I set my heart, a yearning rose, to climb;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It pullulates and blooms in sultry rhyme,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      It spires and speeds aloft, in spite of drouth.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And seeking for that sweeter rose, your mouth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That beckons from some balcony sublime,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It heeds no whit the tick-tack-tock of Time
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And with its sweetness all the night endow'th.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      O beauteous rose! O shrub without a thorn!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O velvet petals unsmutched of the mire!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For this my life was manifestly born,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To climb toward thy lips, and never tire!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Now ope thy shutter in the flood of mom&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Lean out, and smile, and pluck thy heart's desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems strange,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;that a man can buy a good meal with a thing
      like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a petrarch, anyway?&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Gee, you'll have to brush your
      hair to keep it out of your eyebrows,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Herod was petrarch of
      Galilee, don't you remember? It's a kind of comptroller or efficiency
      expert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Herod was patriarch of Galilee, not petrarch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Lester was busy multiplying twenty by fifty-two, and adding
      sixty, and he did not attempt to put Laura's friend right in the eyes of
      his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, at the office, Lester took occasion to stroll over to
      the corner where Miss Denver was tickling the keys. Her delicious, able
      fingers flashed like the boreal aurora; the incomparable smoothness of her
      neck and throat fascinated him; her clear, blue-washed gray eyes startled
      him with their merry archness. Wambling inwardly, he met her gaze as
      coolly as he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to Moretti's to-night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry; I've got a date to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ached in spirit. &ldquo;To-morrow night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment, tapping the desk with a rosy finger nail. Then her
      face brightened. &ldquo;I'd love to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he returned to his desk and the dull routine of writing press notes for
      Petunia Veal's latest novel, he uttered a phrase that he had caught from
      Harry Hanover. It was the first sign of his emancipation from Mallarmé and
      the Oxford Movement, for certainly that phrase had never been heard on the
      quilted lawns of Balliol: &ldquo;She's a prize package, all right, all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten days elapsed. All six sonnets had been delivered and paid for, and Mr.
      Arundel had bargained for a few extra rondeaux, at five dollars each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antipasto, minestrone, breadsticks, force-meat balls, and here we are
      again at the spaghetti and Hackensack Chianti. Lester had mailed his MS.
      on &ldquo;Clara Tice and the Pleinaerists of Greenwich Village&rdquo; to the <i>Oblique
      Review</i> that afternoon, and had calculated that the editors could not
      in any decency offer him less than fifty&mdash;or perhaps forty&mdash;dollars
      for it. This, added to 20 by 52 plus 60 plus the rondeaux and other
      probable increments, would certainly support two in a garret for some
      time. He also had hopes of selling some obscenarios for the movies. Pearl
      would probably want to go on with her work, for a while at any rate. She
      was so independent! But those clear eyes of hers, like a March sky with
      teasings of April in it, how tender and laughing they were! A few nights
      ago they had taken a long bus ride together, and she had forgotten her
      muff. She let him warm her hands instead. He went home that night feeling
      strong enough to bite lamp-posts in two, and had waked up Jack and Harry
      to put them right about Petrarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearl was teaching Lester to twirl up his spaghetti with fork and spoon,
      instead of draping it out of his mouth like Spanish moss. Suddenly she
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The dear old <i>Oblique</i> has gone
      blooie! Mr. Arundel called up the editor to-day and told him the Barmecide
      Company won't supply him with any more paper until he pays his bills. Of
      course that means he'll have to quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester was touched in two vital spots: his own private hopes, and his zeal
      for fly-specked literature. &ldquo;Shades of Frank Harris!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If that
      isn't just like Arundel! Why, that man is pure and simple <i>bourgeois!</i>
      I never heard of such a thing. Has he no feeling at all for art?&rdquo; Pearl
      laughed&mdash;the pure, musical laugh of careless girlishness, but the
      recording angel caught in the nimble chords a faint overtone of something
      else&mdash;like the tinkle of ice in a misty tumbler. &ldquo;Oh, he has his own
      ideas about art,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He's taken to writing poetry himself. You
      never heard such stuff&mdash;I've been meaning to tell you. What does
      'pullulate' mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester's valiant heart, Lester's manly hands that had acted as a muff on a
      Riverside Drive bus, trembled and stiffened. &ldquo;<i>It 'pullulates and blooms
      in sultry rhyme</i>,&rdquo; she quoted gayly. &ldquo;Now what do you make of that, as
      referring to Mr. Arundel's heart? Sultry is right, too!&rdquo; Lion-hearted
      Harvard, oak-bosomed Balliol, and all the mature essences of manhood were
      needed to keep Lester calm. How had she seen these secret strains? She
      must have been peeping into the chief's private correspondence. He
      hesitated during six inches of spaghetti. &ldquo;Search me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it in
      Walter Mason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's his own stuff, I tell you. <i>O beauteous rose! O shrub without
      a thorn!</i>&rdquo; she chanted, and her laughter popped like a champagne cork.
      The horrid truth burst upon him. The boss was courting the angel of the
      office with the very ammunition that Lester himself had furnished, and his
      vow of secrecy forbade him to disclose the truth. Oh, the paltry meanness
      of fate, the villainy of circumstance! It is impossible to describe the
      pangs it cost him to dissemble, cloak, disguise, and conceal the anguish
      he felt. But dissemble, cloak, disguise, and conceal he did, and though
      his heart glowed like an angry cigar stub, he reached home at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he sat down at his table, and amid the healthy snores of his
      roommates he concocted a fine piece of literary ordnance. Late and grimly
      he toiled and contrived. At length he had fashioned a sonnet which would
      be the golden sum and substance of the previous sequence; a cry of the
      heart so splendidly forensic that Mr. Arundel would pounce upon it,
      yielding his crisp steel engraving in return. But see, the asp concealed
      in the basket of fruit, the adder in the woodpile! Read Lester's sonnet as
      an acrostic:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Over that trellis where the moon distills
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      My heart is climbing like a rambler rose:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      You lean and listen to the whippoorwills,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Heedless of how the fragrant blossom grows!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O beauteous rose! O shrub without a thorn!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      When wilt thou realize my love in sooth?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I touch the windowsill with heart forlorn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Hoping the guerdon of thy bounteous youth.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      After the grief and teen of bitter days,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Troubled by woes that cicatrize and burn,

    <p class="indent15">
      Ever at eventide I seek thy praise,

    <p class="indent20">
      Yearning thy maiden bliss&mdash;I yearn, I yearn!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Over the rotten fruit of buried years
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Unbar the bolt&mdash;have pity on my tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The discerning reader will spot the glittering falchion of malice lurking
      in the initial letters. Read them downward, they convey: <i>o my how I
      hate you!</i> Lester had but to convey this poisoned comfit to his chief:
      then, playing upon the artless Pearl, persuade her to show it to him&mdash;point
      out the murderous duplicity of the love token; and she would recoil into
      his arms. Greenwich Village would sound the timbrel of joy, and even the
      <i>Oblique</i> might find a softer-hearted papyrus vendor. <i>Vos
      plaudite!</i> With such thoughts, amid the wailing matin song of
      boarding-house steam pipes, our hero fell into a brief slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning Lester hastened to the office. He waited feverishly until the
      hour when the chief usually arrived, then visited the private office.
      There he found the vice-president going over the morning mail. &ldquo;Is&mdash;is
      Mr. Arundel in?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arundel isn't here to-day,&rdquo; said the vicepresident. &ldquo;He will be away
      two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lester retired queasily, and hurried to the corner sacred to Miss Denver.
      Here he found one of the other stenographers using Pearl's machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Miss Denver?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady, of humorous turn, looked at her wrist watch. &ldquo;Getting
      ready to go over the top,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you heard? She marries the boss this morning.&rdquo;

      ADVICE TO TO LOVELORN

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ISS ANN AUSTIN
      came briskly into her little cupboard of a room at the back of the <i>Evening
      Planet</i> office. She hung up her hat and coat, opened her rolltop desk,
      put her small handbag carefully in a drawer, and looked at herself in a
      greenish mirror that hung secretly on a hook in the recess under the
      pigeonholes. She took the rubber hood off her typewriter, poured three
      paper cupfuls of drinking water on the potted geranium on the windowledge,
      wound up the cheap clock on top of the desk, and moved it forward ten
      minutes to compensate for what it had lost during the night. Now she was
      ready for work. As she wound up the clock, the usual thought occurred to
      her&mdash;when would she be able to buy herself the handsome little wrist
      watch she coveted? There were a lot of them in the jeweller's shop on Park
      Row, and she admired them every morning on her way to the office. But when
      one is supporting one's self and an invalid mother in an uptown apartment,
      and has to pay for a woman to come in during the day to lend a hand, all
      on fifty dollars a week, in an era of post-bellum prices, wrist watches
      have to wait. However, as Ann made the daily correction in her laggard
      clock she used to say to herself: &ldquo;There's a better time coming.&rdquo; She was
      not devoid of humour, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the office boy would bring in the big pile of morning mail, grinning
      as he laid it on the pullout slide of her desk. He may be excused for
      grinning, because Ann was the kind of creature who would bring a smile to
      the surliest face. She was just a nice size, with a face that was both
      charming and sensible, and merry brown eyes (when it wasn't too close to
      the first of the month). Also, that pile of mail <i>was</i> rather
      amusing. Those letters, so many of them written on cheap pink or blue
      stationery and addressed in unsophisticated handwriting, were not directed
      to Miss Ann Austin, but to &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; and the office boy knew pretty well
      the kind of messages that were in them. For Ann, under the pseudonym of
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; conducted the <i>Planet's</i> department of Advice to the
      Lovelorn, and daily several score of puzzled or distracted beings bared
      their hearts to her. The pile of letters was growing bigger, too. The <i>Planet</i>,
      which was not a very flourishing paper just at that time, had started the
      Advice to the Lovelorn department a few months before, and had put Ann in
      charge of it because she had done so well writing sob stories. It was
      beginning to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; quite surprisingly as a circulation feature,
      especially since her smiling little picture, vignetted in a cut with a
      border of tiny hearts, had been put at the head of the column. Under the
      cut was the legend: &ldquo;Cynthia, a Sympathetic Adviser in Matters of the
      Heart.&rdquo; Ann didn't know whether to be pleased or not at the growing
      popularity of her feature. This was not quite the kind of thing she had
      hoped for when she entered the newspaper world. But&mdash;the more letters
      there were from the lovelorn, the sooner she might get that needed raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a little sigh she got out her penknife, began slitting the envelopes,
      ceased to be Ann Austin and became Cynthia, the sage and gentle arbiter
      over her troubled parliament of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a task that required no small discretion and tact, because Cynthia,
      whatever her private misgivings, tried to perform it with some honest
      idealism. In the first place, the letters that were obviously merely
      humorous, or were amorous attempts to inveigle her into private
      correspondence, were discarded. Then the letters to be used in the next
      day's column had to be selected, and laid aside to be printed with her
      comment on the ethical or sociological problems involved. The remaining
      letters had all to be answered, and data noted down that would be useful
      in compiling the pamphlet &ldquo;1001 Problems of Courtship&rdquo; that the managing
      editor insisted on her preparing. He said it would be great circulation
      dope. Ann didn't care much for the managing editor, Mr. Sikes. He had a
      way of coming into her room, closing the door behind him, leaning over her
      desk, and saying: &ldquo;Well, how's little Miss Cupid?&rdquo; If it hadn't been for
      that habit of his, Ann would have spoken to him about a raise before now.
      But she had an uneasy feeling that it would not be pleasing to put herself
      in the position of asking him favours. She would have been still more
      disturbed if she had known that some of the boys in the city room used to
      talk about &ldquo;Cupid and Sikey&rdquo; when they saw him visit her room. They said
      it angrily, because Ann was a general office favourite. Even the coloured
      elevator man had brought his wooing problems to her one day, wanting to be
      reassured as to his technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all very well for you to scoff, superior reader, but letters such as
      Ann had to read every morning bring an honest pang to an understanding
      heart; particularly when that heart is in collaboration with twenty-two
      years of bright, brown-eyed, high-spirited girlhood. Perhaps you don't
      realize how many of us are young and ignorant and at work in offices, and
      absorbed, out of working hours, in the universal passion. A good many make
      shift to be cynical and worldly-wise in public, but who knows how
      ravishingly sentimental we are in private? Some say that Doctor Freud
      didn't tell the half of it. As that waggish poet Keith Preston has
      remarked,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Love, lay thy phobias to rest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Inhibit thy taboo!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We twain shall share, forever blest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A complex built for two!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A complex built for two was the ambition of most of Ann's correspondents;
      but mainly her letters exhibited the seamy side of Love's purple mantle.
      You see, when lovers are perfectly happy, they don't write to the papers
      about it. And when she pondered gravely over &ldquo;Brokenhearted's&rdquo; letter
      saying that she has just learned that a perfectly splendid fellow she is
      so infatuated with has a wife and three children in Detroit; or over
      &ldquo;Puzzled's&rdquo; inquiry as to whether she is &ldquo;a bum sport&rdquo; because she
      wouldn't let the dark young man kiss her good-night, she sometimes said to
      herself that Napoleon was right. Napoleon, you remember, remarked that
      Love causes more unhappiness than anything else in the world. And then she
      would turn to her typewriter, and put under &ldquo;Puzzled's&rdquo; inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>No, &ldquo;Puzzled,&rdquo; do not let him kiss you unless you are betrothed. If any
      one is a &ldquo;bum sport&rdquo; it is he for wanting to do so. If he &ldquo;always kisses
      the girls good-night when he has had a good time,&rdquo; he is not your sort. A
      man that does not respect a girl before marriage will certainly not
      respect her afterward.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had typed these replies she always hastily took the paper out of
      her typewriter and tucked it away in her desk. She did not like the idea
      of Mr. Sikes coming in and reading it over her shoulder, as he had done
      once. That was the time she had used the quotation &ldquo;Pains of Love are
      sweeter far than all other pleasures are&rdquo; in answering &ldquo;Desolate.&rdquo; The
      managing editor had repeated the verse in a way that both angered and
      alarmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular morning, among the other letters was one that interested
      her both by the straightforward simplicity of its statement and by the
      clear, vigorous handwriting on sensible plain notepaper. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Cynthia:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I am a young business man, very much in love, and I need your help. I
      have fallen in love with a girl who does not know me. I do not even know
      her name but I know her by sight, and I know where she works. She looks
      like the only one for me, but I don't want to do anything disrespectful.
      Would it be a mistake for me to call at her office and try to get a chance
      to meet her? Do you think she would be offended? She looks very adorable.
      Please tell me honestly what you think.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Respectfully yours,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sincerity.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied by the maunderings of many idiotic flappers and baby vamps, this
      appeal attracted her. She put it into the column for the following day,
      writing underneath it:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>You never can tell, &ldquo;Sincerity&rdquo;! It all depends upon you. If you are
      the right kind of man, she ought not to be offended. Why not take a
      chance? Faint heart never won fair lady.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was trying enough, Ann used to think, to have to pore over the troubles
      of her lovelorn clients on paper; but the worst times were when they came
      to call on her at the office. Fortunately this did not happen very often,
      for the stricken maidens and young Lochinvars who make up the chief
      support of such columns as hers are safely and busily shut up among
      typewriters and filing cases during the daytime; their wounds do not begin
      to burn intolerably until about five-thirty p.m. But now and then some
      forlorn and baffled creature would find his or her way to &ldquo;Cynthia&rdquo; and
      ask her advice. She would listen sympathetically, apply such homely
      febrifuge as her inexperienced but wise heart suggested to her, and after
      the patient had gone she would add the case to her list of 1001 Problems.
      The material for the pamphlet was growing rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, while the managing editor was in her room asking her how soon
      the booklet would be ready, the office boy brought in a card neatly
      engraved <i>Mr. Arthur Caldwell</i>. Now as a rule Cynthia did not see
      masculine visitors, because (after one or two trying experiences) she had
      found that they were inclined to transfer to her the heart that someone
      else had bruised. But in this case she welcomed the caller because Mr.
      Sikes was being annoyingly facetious. He had looked over her laboriously
      gathered data for the 1001 Problems, and had said: &ldquo;Well, you're getting
      to be quite an experienced little girl in these matters, hey?&rdquo; He had
      seemed disposed to linger on the topic with pleasure. Therefore Cynthia
      told the office boy to send Mr. Caldwell in, though the name meant nothing
      to her. Mr. Sikes went out, and the caller was introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Caldwell proved to be a young man, quite as nice-looking as the
      collar-advertising young men without being so desperately handsome.
      Cynthia liked him from the first glance. There was something that seemed
      very genuine about his soft collar and his candid, clean-shaven face and
      the little brown brief-case he carried. He had on brown woollen socks,
      too, she noticed, in one of those quick feminine observations. He seemed
      very embarrassed, and his face suddenly went ruby red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Cynthia?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ann, pushing aside a mass of lovelorn correspondence, and
      wondering what the trouble could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name's Caldwell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look here, I suppose you'll think me an
      awful idiot, but I wanted to ask your advice. I&mdash;I wrote you a letter
      the other day, and your answer in the column made me think that perhaps
      you wouldn't mind giving me some help. I wrote that letter signed
      'Sincerity'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was obviously ill at ease, and Ann tried to help him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the letter perfectly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you take my advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm a bit uncertain about it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to explain to you a little more fully, and see what you
      think. You see I happened to see this girl one day, going into her office.
      I suppose the idea about love at first sight is all exploded, but I had a
      hunch as soon as I saw her that&mdash;&mdash;Oh, well, that I would like
      to know her. I've seen her going in and out of the building, but she has
      never seen me, never even heard of me. I don't know any one who can
      introduce me to her, and I can't just walk up to her and tell her I'm
      crazy about her. They don't do that except in Shakespeare. I don't know
      much about girls and I thought maybe you could suggest some way in which I
      could meet her without frightening her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ann pondered. She liked the young man's way of putting his problem, and it
      was plain from his genuine embarrassment that he was sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd love to help you, if I could,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It seems to me that the
      only way to go about it is to arrange some business with the firm she
      works for, and try to meet her that way. Couldn't that be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's secretary to one of the big bugs in the Telephone Company,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I'm in the publishing business. I don't see any way in which I
      could fake up a business connection there. The worst of it is, there may
      be a dozen fellows in love with her already, for all I know. I suppose I
      might get a job with the Telephone Company, but by the time I had worked
      up far enough to have an excuse for going into the vice-president's office
      where she works, someone else might have married her.&rdquo; He laughed, a
      boyish, ingratiating chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem pretty hard,&rdquo; said Ann. &ldquo;I don't know what to say.&rdquo; She had
      a mental picture of the unknown fair one, going in and out of the big
      Telephone Company's building on Dey Street, unaware of the admiring
      glances of this bashful admirer. &ldquo;I'll bet the men she knows aren't half
      as nice as he is,&rdquo; she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to know that she reads your column,&rdquo; said Caldwell. &ldquo;I suppose
      there isn't any way I could get in touch with her through that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's any legitimate way I can help,&rdquo; Ann said, &ldquo;I'll be glad to.
      But I hardly see what I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thanks awfully,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I get a chance to meet her, will you
      let me come in again and tell you about it? Perhaps you would let me
      mention your name as a reference, in regard to my respectability I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you can give her better references than that? You see, I don't
      know so very much about you, Mr. Caldwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In matters like this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I guess you're the Big Authority. And by
      the way, do you ever do any book reviewing? I work for Fawcett and
      Company, the publishers, and we'd like immensely to have your comment on
      some of our love stories. Can I send you some books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't promise to review them,&rdquo; said Ann, rather pleased, because this
      seemed to her a way to earn a little extra money. &ldquo;But I'll speak to the
      literary editor, and we'll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I send them to your home address,&rdquo; said Caldwell. &ldquo;I know what a
      newspaper office is, if I send them here someone else might snitch them.
      Give me your street number, and you'll be spared the trouble of taking
      them home to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very kind of you,&rdquo; said Ann. &ldquo;Miss Ann Austin, 527 West 150th
      Street. Well, you let me know what happens about your fair lady. I wish
      you all sorts of luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Arthur Caldwell got outside the office, he looked down Park Row to
      where the great Telephone Building rose up behind the brown silhouette of
      St. Paul's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caldwell,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;you're an infernal liar! But it pays!
      I'll figure out some way. While there's life there's dope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set out for the subway, but paused again to meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann Austin!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By George, she's a queen.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is not the
      purpose of this tale to tell in detail how Arthur Caldwell laid siege to
      Ann Austin. He was a cautious man, and for some time he contented himself
      by presenting occasional reports of his progress with the damsel of the
      Telephone Company. Ann, in her friendly and unselfish way, was delighted
      to hear, a few days later, that he had met his ideal. Then, averring that
      he needed further counsel, Arthur persuaded her to have lunch with him one
      day; and Ann, convinced that the young man was in love with someone else,
      saw no reason why this should not be done. Perhaps it was a little odd
      that at their various meetings they should have talked so much of
      themselves, their ambitions, the books they had been reading, and so on;
      and so little of the Telephone lady. But surely it was strictly a matter
      of business that Arthur should send Miss Austin some of Fawcett's novels,
      for her to review in the <i>Planet</i>; and equally a professional matter
      that he should discuss with her her opinion of them. And then came the day
      when Arthur called up to say that things were going so well with the
      Telephone lady that he wanted Cynthia to meet her; and would she join them
      in St. Paul's Churchyard at half-past twelve? Ann, with just a curious
      little unanalyzed twinge in her heart, agreed to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she reached the bench in the graveyard, where a bright autumn
      sunshine filled the clearing among those tremendous buildings, Arthur was
      there alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Alice?&rdquo; said Ann, innocently&mdash;for such was the name Arthur
      had always given the lady of the Telephone Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She couldn't come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I want to show you her picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down on the bench, and he took out of his pocket a copy of the
      noon edition of the <i>Planet</i>. He turned to the feature page, and
      displayed the little cut of Cynthia at the head of the Lovelorn column.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, stoutly (though his heart was tremulous within him),
      &ldquo;there, you adorable little thing, there she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be pleasant to linger over this scene, but, as I have just said,
      this is not our <i>denouement,</i> but only an incident. Ann, shot through
      with delicious pangs of doubt and glory and anger, asked for explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you mean to say there never was any Alice, the beautiful Telephone
      blonde?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What a fraud you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You dear, delightful innocent, I just had to
      cook up some excuse for coming up to see you. And you can't be angry with
      me now, Ann, because in your own answer to Sincerity's letter you said the
      girl ought not to be offended. You told me to take a chance! Just think
      what self-control I had, that first time I came up to see you, not to
      blurt out the truth.&rdquo; And then he tore off a scrap of margin from the
      newspaper and measured her finger for a ring.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here were happy
      evenings that winter, when Ann, after finishing her stint at the office,
      would hasten up their rendezvous at Piazza's little Italian table d'hote.
      Here, over the minestrone soup and the spaghetti and that strong Italian
      coffee that seems to have a greenish light round the edges of the liquid
      (and an equally greenish taste), they would discuss their plans and
      platitudes, just as lovers always have and always will. As for Ann, the
      light of a mystical benevolence shone in her as she conned her daily pile
      of broken hearts in the morning mail. More than ever she felt that she,
      who had seen the true flame upon the high altar, had a duty to all
      perplexed and random followers of the gleam who had gone astray in their
      search. Aware more keenly that the troubled appeals of &ldquo;Tearful&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Little Pal,&rdquo; however absurd, were the pains of genuine heartache, she
      became more and more tender in her comments, and her correspondence grew
      apace. Now that she knew that her job need not go on forever she tried
      honestly to run the column with all her might. How stern she was with the
      flirt and the vamp and the jilt; how sympathetic with the wounded on
      Love's great battle-field. &ldquo;Great stuff, great stuff!&rdquo; Mr. Sikes would
      cry, in his coarse way, and complimented her on the increasing &ldquo;kick&rdquo; of
      her department. Knowing that he attributed the accelerated pulse of the
      Lovelorn column to mere cynicism on her part, she did not dare wear her
      ring in the office for fear of being joked about it. She used to think
      sadly that because she had made sympathy with lovers a matter of trade,
      she herself, now she was in love, could hope for no understanding.
      Although she hardly admitted it, she longed for the day when she could
      drop the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Arthur met her at Piazza's, radiant. He was going off on a
      long business trip for his publishing house, and they had promised him a
      substantial raise when he returned. They sat down to dinner together in
      the highest spirits. Arthur, in particular, was in a triumphant mood: the
      publishing world, it seemed, lay under his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great news, hey?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We'll be able to get married in the spring,
      and you can kick out of that miserable job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Arthur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know I have to take care of Mother. Don't
      you think it would be wiser if I went on with the work for a while, until
      your next raise comes? It would help a good deal, and we'd be able to put
      a little away for a rainy day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you think I'm going to have my wife doing that
      lovelorn stuff in the paper every day? It'd make me a laughing stock if it
      ever got out. No, <i>sir!</i> I haven't said much about it, because I knew
      it couldn't be helped; but believe me, honey, that isn't the right kind of
      job for you. I've often wondered you didn't feel that yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ann was a little nettled that he should put it that way. Whatever her
      private distaste for the Lovelorn column, it had served her well in a
      difficult time, and had paid the doctor's bills at home. And she knew how
      much honest devotion she had put into the task of trying to give helpful
      counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was through the column that we first met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What evil divinity sat upon Arthur's tongue that he could not see this was
      the moment for a word of tenderness? But a young man flushed with his
      first vision of business success, the feeling that now nothing can prevent
      him from &ldquo;making good,&rdquo; is likely to be obtuse to the finer shades of
      intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, dear, I could see you were different from the usual sob sister
      of the press,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I could see you didn't really fall for that
      stuff. It's because I love you so, I want to get you out of that cheap,
      degrading sensational work. Most of those letters you get are only fakes,
      anyway. I think Love ought to be sacred, not used as mere circulation bait
      for a newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ann was a high-spirited girl, and this blunt criticism touched her in that
      vivid, quivering region of the mind where no woman stops to reason. But
      she made an honest attempt to be patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Arthur,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;there's nothing really cheap and degraded in
      trying to help others who haven't had the same advantages we have. I know
      a lot of the letters I print are silly and absurd, but not more so than
      some of the books you publish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen,&rdquo; he said, loftily, &ldquo;we won't quarrel about this. I don't
      want you to go on with the job, that's all. It isn't fair to you. You may
      take the work seriously, and put all sorts of idealism into it, but it's
      not the right kind of job for a refined girl. How about the men in the
      office? I'll bet I know what <i>they</i> think of it. They probably think
      it's a devil of a good joke, and laugh about it among themselves. Don't
      you think I've seen that managing editor leering at you? That sort of
      thing cheapens a girl among decent men. Every Lovelace in town feels he
      has a right to send you mash-notes, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ann was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're the only one I ever paid any attention to,&rdquo; she said,
      blazing at him. &ldquo;I'm sorry you think I've cheapened myself. I guess I
      have, by letting you interfere with my affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped the ring from her finger, and thrust it at him. Arthur saw,
      too late, what he had done. She listened in scornful silence to his
      miserable attempts to console her, which were doubly handicapped by the
      old waiter hovering near. She was still adamant while he took her up town.
      The only thing she said was when she reached the door of her apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want you to cheapen yourself. You needn't come any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Arthur also was thoroughly angry. The next morning he went
      away on his business trip, realizing for the first time that he who has
      the pass key to a human heart treads among dangerous explosives.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ow different the
      little room in the Planet office looked to Ann when she returned, with a
      sick heart, to her work the next morning. Everything was just the same&mdash;the
      geranium on its windowledge, that seemed to survive both the eddying hot
      air from the steampipes beneath it and the daily douche of iced drinking
      water; the noisily ticking inaccurate little clock; the dusty typewriter.
      All were the same, and there was the pile of morning letters from Love's
      battered henchmen. To office boy and casual reporter Ann herself seemed
      the usual cheerful charmer with her crisp little white collar and dark,
      alluring hair. Her swift, capable hands sped over the pile of letters,
      slitting the envelopes and sorting the outcries into some classification
      of her own. Outwardly nothing had altered, but everything seemed to have
      lost its meaning. What a desolate emptiness gaped beneath the firm routine
      of her daily life. She was struck by the irony of the fact that the only
      one in the office who seemed to notice that something was amiss was the
      one person whom she disliked&mdash;Mr. Sikes. He came in about something
      or other, and then stayed, looking at her intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look sick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What's the matter, is the love feast getting on
      your nerves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a queer twitching at the corners of her mouth, she forced herself to
      say some trifling remark. He leaned over her and put his hand on hers. She
      caught the strong cigarry whiff of his clothes, which sickened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much love in the abstract,&rdquo; he said, insinuatingly. &ldquo;What you need is
      a little love in the concrete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If he&mdash;or any one&mdash;had spoken tenderly to her, she would have
      burst into tears. But the boorishness of his words was just the tonic she
      needed. She looked at him with flashing eyes, and was about to say: &ldquo;Keep
      to some topic you understand.&rdquo; Then she dared not say it, for now she
      could not run the risk of losing her job. She faced him steadily, in angry
      silence. He left the room, and the little green-tarnished mirror under the
      pigeonholes saw tears for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irony of her position moved her cruelly when she began her task of
      dealing with the correspondents. Here she was, giving helpful, cheery
      advice, posing as all-wise in these matters, when her own love affair had
      come so miserably to grief. In the ill-written scrawls on scented and
      scalloped paper she could hear an echo of her own suffering. &ldquo;Hopeless&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Uncertain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Miss Eighteen&rdquo; got very tender replies that day. And
      how she laid the lash upon &ldquo;Beau Brummel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Disillusioned,&rdquo; those
      self-assured young men, who had chosen that mail to contribute their views
      on the flirtatious and unreliable qualities of modern girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitterness of her paradoxical task became dulled as the days went on,
      but there were other troubles, too, to bother her. Her mother, quick and
      querulous to detect unhappiness, fell into one of her nervous spells, and
      the doctor had to be called in again. The woman-by-the-day got
      blood-poisoning in her arm, and could not come. The landlord gave notice
      of a coming raise in rent. A fat letter came from Arthur, and in a flush
      of passion she destroyed it unread. If it hadn't been such a fat letter,
      she said to herself, it wouldn't have annoyed her so to see it. But she
      wasn't going to wade through pages of explanation of just what he had
      meant. She was still cut to the quick when she remembered the cavalier and
      easy way in which he had scoffed at her work. And then, as time went by,
      she found herself moving into a new mood&mdash;no longer one of
      exaggerated tenderness toward her clients, but a feeling almost cynical.
      &ldquo;They're all fools, just as I am,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning she found on her desk a note from the managing editor:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Miss Cupid:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>We've made some changes in our budget, and I've been authorized to
      fatten your envelope $15 a week. I'm glad to do this, because the Lovelorn
      stuff is going big. Just keep kidding them along and everything will be
      fine. Maybe some day we can syndicate it. Hope this will cheer you up,
      don't look so blue at your friends.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sikes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a time when the tone and phrasing of this note might have
      seemed offensive, but in the numbness of despondency Ann had felt lately,
      it was a fine burst of rosy warmth. Thank God, she said to herself,
      something has broken my way at last! She wondered if she had been mistaken
      in Sikes, after all? Perhaps he was really a friend of hers, and she had
      misunderstood his odd ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day at noon she went down to the cashier's department to cash a small
      check. There was no one in the cage, but in the adjoining compartment,
      behind a wall of filing cases, she could hear two girls talking. One of
      them said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see Sikes has put through a raise for Lovelorn. Pretty soft for her,
      hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll have to give value received, I guess,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Sikes
      figures if he puts that over for her, she'll fall for him. She's been
      stalling him for quite a while, but I suppose he's got her fixed now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fled, aghast, ran down to another floor so as not to be seen, and took
      the elevator. Out on the street she walked mechanically along Park Row and
      found herself opposite St. Paul's. She wandered in and sat down on a
      bench. It was a chilly day, and the churchyard was nearly empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this was Sikes's friendliness; and she, utterly innocent even in
      thought, was already the subject of vulgar office gossip. For the first
      time there broke in upon her, with bitter force, the knowledge that no
      matter how easy it may be to counsel others, few of us are wise in our own
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitiable paradox: she, the &ldquo;sympathetic adviser in matters of the heart,&rdquo;
       had made shipwreck of her own happiness. How right Arthur had been, and
      how childish and mad she, to reject his just instinct. It was true: she
      had made use of Love for mere newspaper circulation; and now Love had died
      between her hands. Well, this was the end. No matter what happened, she
      could not go on with the job. Cold and trembling with nervousness, she
      returned to her desk, to finish her column for the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her typewriter lay some letters, which had come in while she was out.
      She opened one, and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Cynthia:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I am in great trouble, please help me. I am in love with a fellow and
      know he is all right and we would be very happy together. We were engaged
      to be married, and everything was lovely. But he objected to the work I
      was doing, said it was not a good job for a girl and that I ought to give
      it up. I knew he was right, but the way he said it made me mad. I guess I
      am hot-tempered and stubborn&mdash;anyway, I told him to mind his own
      business, and he went away. Now I am heart-broken, because I love him and
      I know he loves me. Tell me what to do.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jessie.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ann sat looking at the cheap blue paper with the initial J gaudily
      embossed upon it in gilt. In the sprawling lines of unlettered handwriting
      she saw an exact parallel to her own unhappy rupture with Arthur. How much
      more clearly we can see the answer in others' tangles than in our own!
      Jessie, with her pathetic pretentious gilt initial, knew that she had been
      in the wrong, and was brave enough to want to make amends. And she&mdash;had
      she not been less true to Love than Jessie? Her false pride and obstinacy
      had brought their own punishment. Seeing the situation through Jessie's
      eyes, she could read her duty plain. Arthur, no doubt, was through with
      her forever, but she must play the game no less.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put Jessie's letter at the head of the Lovelorn column for the next
      day. Under it she wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Certainly, dear Jessie, if you feel you were in the wrong, you ought to
      take the first step toward making up. Probably he was tactless in
      criticizing you, but I am sure he only did it because he had your true
      interest at heart. So write him a nice letter and be happy together. Your
      friend Cynthia hopes it will all come out all right, because she has seen
      other cases like this where false pride caused great suffering. If he is
      the right man, he will love you all the more after he gets your letter.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ann sent up her copy to the composing room, and then going to a telephone
      booth she called up Fawcett and Company and asked for Mr. Caldwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Caldwell's not here any longer,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serves me right,&rdquo; said Ann to herself. &ldquo;Can you tell me where I can find
      him?&rdquo; she asked, wondering how it was that one so miserable could still
      speak in such a pleasant and apparently unconcerned tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fawcett operator switched her to another wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; said a stenographer, &ldquo;Mr. Fawcett left here about two weeks
      ago. He's got a job out of town&mdash;in Boston, I think. I can find out
      for you in the morning if you'll call again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Ann.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a horror of facing Mr. Sikes in her present wretchedness, so
      before she went home she wrote him a note, resigning her job, and asking
      permission to leave as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she had to nerve herself to face his protests, and the
      friendly remarks of all the staff when the news spread. It was a hideous
      ordeal, but she managed to get through it smiling. But by evening she was
      inwardly a wreck. In her present mood, she had an instinctive longing to
      revisit the shabby little restaurant where she and Arthur had spent so
      many happy hours. She knew it would give her pain; but she felt that pain
      was what she needed&mdash;sharp, clean, insistent pain to ease the
      oppression and disgust of what she had been through. Remorse, she felt, is
      surgical in action: it cuts away foul tissues of the mind. She could not,
      without preparatory discipline, face her mother's outcry at hearing she
      had given up her job.

    <p>
      In the crisp blue evening air the bright front of Piazza's café shone with
      a warm and generous lustre. From sheer force of habit, her heart lightened
      a little as she climbed the stairs and entered the familiar place, where
      festoons of red and green paper decoration criss-crossed above the warm,
      soup-flavoured, tobacco-fogged room. There was a clatter of thick dishes
      and a clamour of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One?&rdquo; said the head waiter, his wiry black hair standing erect as though
      in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and followed him down the narrow aisle. There was the little
      table, in the corner under the stair, where they had always sat. A man was
      there, reading a newspaper.... Her heart felt very strange, as though it
      had dropped a long way below its usual place. It was Arthur, and he was
      smiling at her as though nothing had happened. He was getting up. . . he
      was shaking hands with her. . . how natural it all seemed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all really great crises, it was over in a flash. She found herself
      sitting at the little table, taking off her gloves in the most casual
      fashion. Arthur was whispering outrageous things. How fine it is that
      everybody talks so loud in Italian table d'hôtes, and the waiters crash
      the dishes round so recklessly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur's talk seemed to be in two different keys, partly for the benefit
      of old Tonio, the waiter, and partly for her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here you are! I wondered how soon you'd get here.... <i>Have you
      forgiven me, dearest?</i>. . . Do you want some minestrone?. . . <i>Why
      didn't you answer my letters, brownest eyes?</i> . . . Yes, and some of
      the near-beer.. . . <i>Darling, it was all my fault. I wrote to tell you
      so. Didn't you get my letter?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all, at such times there isn't much explaining done, A happy
      reconciliation is the magic of a moment, and no explanations are
      necessary. The trouble just drops away, and life begins again from the
      last kind thing that was said. All Ann could do was whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Arthur&mdash;it was I who was wrong. I&mdash;I've given up the
      Lovelorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, after a sudden moisture of eye on both sides, the steaming
      minestrone came on in its battered leaden tureen from which the silver
      plating disappeared long ago, and under pretense of serving her soup
      Arthur stretched out his hand. She put out hers to meet it, and found the
      ring slipped deftly back on her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Arthur,&rdquo; she said, presently, &ldquo;I thought you were out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've got a new job, with King and Company in Boston. A
      good job, too, we can be married right away, and you don't need to worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did you happen to come here tonight? You didn't know I was
      going to be here. I didn't know it myself until an hour or so ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I willed you to come, who knows?&rdquo; he said, gaily. &ldquo;Have you been
      advising lovers all this while, and didn't know that they always haunt the
      scenes of former felicity? I've been in town several days, and came here
      every night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced a copy of the <i>Evening Planet</i> which he had been reading
      when she came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a special reason for thinking you might come here to-night,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;This afternoon I read your column, and I saw Jessie's letter and
      your answer. What you said made me think that perhaps you might be willing
      to forgive me.&rdquo; Ann, once more safely enthroned on the shining glory of
      her happiness, felt that she could afford to tease him just a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so you admit that some of those letters people write me
      <i>are</i> genuine, and that the answers do some good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her and laid his hand over the ring, which outglittered even
      the most newly nickeled of Piazza's cutlery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, honey,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I admit it. And I knew that Jessie's letter was
      genuine, because I wrote it myself.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE CURIOUS CASE OF KENELM DIGBY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E HAD been dining
      together at the Hotel Ansonia, and as we walked up the shining breezy
      channel of Broadwhat is the commonest phrase of the detectives? To put two
      and two together. What else, I ask you, is the poet doing all the time but
      putting two and two together&mdash;two rhymes, and then two rhymes more,
      and making a quatrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung his stick, puffed strongly at his cigar, and amorously surveyed
      the deep blue of the night, against which the huge blocks of apartment
      houses spread their random patterns of lighted windows. Between these
      granolithic cliffs flowed a racing stream of bright motors, like the
      rapids of a river of light hurrying downward to the whirlpool of Times
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Dove Dulcet (the well-known poet and literary agent) vigorously
      expounded a theorem which I afterward had occasion to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is every reason,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;why a poet should be the best of
      detectives! My boy, there is a rhyme in events as well as in words. When
      you see two separate and apparently unconnected happenings that seem (as
      one might say) to rhyme together, you begin to suspect one author behind
      them both. It is the function of the poet to have a quick and tender
      apprehension of similarities. The root of poetry is nothing else than
      describing things as being like other apparently quite different things.
      The lady who compared herself to a bird in a gilded cage was chaffed for
      her opulent and spendthrift imagination; but in that lively simile she
      showed an understanding of the poetic principle. Look here:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either for a poet or for a detective,&rdquo; he said, gaily, &ldquo;this seems to me
      the ideal region. I tell you, I walk about here suspecting the most
      glorious crimes. When I see the number of banana splits that are consumed
      in these glittering drugstores, I feel sure that somewhere, in the purple
      silences of the night, hideous consequences must follow. Those who feed so
      violently on that brutalizing mixture of banana, chocolate ice cream,
      cherry syrup, and whipped marshmallow, must certainly be gruesome at
      heart. I look out of my window late at night toward the scattered lights
      of that vast pile of apartments, always thinking to see them blaze some
      great golden symbol or letter into the darkness, some terrible or obscene
      code that means death and terror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your analogy seems to have some sense,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Certainly the minor
      poet, like the law breaker, loves to linger about the scene of his rhyme,
      or crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an amateur of puns,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Then let me tell you the motto
      I have coined to express the spirit of this Little White Way&mdash;<i>Ein
      feste bourgeois ist unser Gott</i>. This is the proud kingdom of the
      triumphant middle class. It is a perilous country for a poet. If he were
      found out, he would be martyred at the nearest subway station. But how I
      love it! See how the quiet side streets cut across highways so richly
      contrasting: West End Avenue, leafy, expensive, and genteel; Broadway, so
      gloriously cruel and artificial; Amsterdam Avenue, so honestly and
      poignantly real. My club is the Hartford Lunch Room, where they call an
      omelet an <i>omulet</i>, and where the mystic word <i>Combo</i> resounds
      through the hatchway to the fat man in the kitchen. My church is the St.
      Agnes branch of the Public Library, over on Amsterdam Avenue. In those
      cool, quiet rooms, when I watch the pensive readers, I have a sense of
      treading near an artery of fine human idealism. In all this various
      neighbourhood I have a cheerful conviction that almost anything might
      happen. In the late afternoons, when the crosswise streets end on a
      glimpse of the Jersey bluffs that glow like smoky blue opals, and smell
      like rotten apples, I feel myself on the very doorsill of the most
      stunning outrages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both laughed, and turned off on Seventy-seventh Street to the small
      apartment house where Dulcet had a comfortable suite of two rooms and
      bath. In his book-lined sitting room we lit our pipes and sat down for a
      gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been talking at dinner of the extraordinary number of grievous
      deaths of well-known authors that had happened that year. As it is almost
      unnecessary to remind you, there was Dunraven Bleak, the humorous
      essayist, who was found stark (in both senses) in his bathtub; and Cynthia
      Carboy, the famous writer of bedtime stories, who fell down the elevator
      shaft. In the case of Mrs. Carboy, the police were distracted because her
      body was found at the top of the building, and the detective bureau
      insisted that in some unexplainable manner she must have fallen <i>up</i>
      the shaft; but as Dulcet pointed out at the time of the Authors' League
      inquiry, the body might have been carried upstairs after the accident.
      Then there was Andrew Baffle, the psychological novelist, whose end was
      peculiarly atrocious and miserable, because it seemed that he had
      contracted tetanus from handling a typewriter ribbon that showed signs of
      having been poisoned. Frank Lebanon, the brilliant short-story writer, was
      stabbed in the fulness of his powers; and there were others whom I do not
      recall at the moment. Mr. Dulcet had suffered severely by these sad
      occurrences, for a number of these authors were his clients, and the loss
      of the commissions on the sale of their works was a serious item. The
      secret of these tragedies had never been discovered, and there had been
      something of a panic among members of the Authors' League. The rumour of a
      pogrom among bestselling writers was tactfully hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your friend Kenelm Digby writing nowadays?&rdquo; I asked, as I looked
      along Dulcet's shelves. Digby, the brilliant novelist, was probably
      Dulcet's most distinguished client, an eccentric fellow who, in spite of
      his excellent royalties, lived a solitary and modest existence in a
      boardinghouse somewhere in that part of the West Side. Outside his own
      circle of intimates Dulcet was almost the only man whom Digby saw much of,
      and many of us, who admired the novelist's work, had our only knowledge of
      his person from hearing the agent talk of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, I'm glad you reminded me,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;Why, he has just
      finished a story, and he telephoned me this afternoon asking me to stop
      over at his house this evening to get the manuscript. He never has any
      dealings with the editors on his own hook&mdash;likes me to attend to all
      his business arrangements for him. I said I'd run over there about ten
      o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That last book of his was a great piece of work,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I've been
      following his stuff for over ten years, and he looks to me about the most
      promising fellow we've got. He has something of the Barrie touch, it seems
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he's the real thing,&rdquo; said Dulcet, blowing a blue cloud of his
      Cartesian Mixture. &ldquo;I only wish he were not quite so eccentric. He lives
      like a hermit-crab, over in a lodging-house near the Park. Even I, who
      know him as well as most people, never feel like intruding on him except
      when he asks me to. I can't help thinking it would be good for him to get
      out more and see something of other men in his line of work. I tried to
      get him to join The Snails, but he says that Amsterdam Avenue is his only
      amusement. And Central Park seems to be his country club. I wonder if
      you've noticed that in his tales whenever he wants to describe a bit of
      country he takes it right out of the Park. I sometimes suspect that's the
      only scenery he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has attained a very unusual status among writers,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;In my
      rambles among bookshops I have noticed that his first editions bring quite
      a good price. It's very seldom that a writer&mdash;at any rate an American&mdash;gets
      'collected' during his lifetime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see any of his manuscript?&rdquo; asked Dulcet; and on my shaking
      my head, he took out a thick packet of foolscap from a cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the original of 'Girlhood',&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Digby gave it to me.
      It'll be worth a lot some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked with interest at the neatly written sheets, thickly covered with
      a small, beautiful, and rather crabbed penmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth a lot!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, I should say so! Why the other day I
      was browsing round in a bookshop and I found a lot of his first editions
      marked at $15 each. It struck me as a very high price for I know I have
      seen them listed for three or four dollars in catalogues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exorbitantly high,&rdquo; Dulcet said. &ldquo;I'm afraid your bookseller is
      profiteering. I admire Digby as much as any one, but that is an artificial
      price. The firsts aren't rare enough to warrant any such price as that.
      Still, I'm glad to know about it as it's a sign of growing recognition. I
      remember the time when it was all I could do to get any editors to look at
      his things. I'll have to tell him about that, it will please him
      mightily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat for a while chatting about this and that and then Dulcet got up and
      put on his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You squat here and be comfortable while I
      run round to Digby. It won't take me more than a few minutes&mdash;he
      lives on Eighty-second Street. I'll be back right speedily, and we can go
      on with our talk.&rdquo; I heard him go down in the elevator, and then I refit
      my pipe, and picked out a book from one of his shelves. I remember that it
      was Brillat-Savarin's amusing &ldquo;Gastronomy as a Fine Art&rdquo;. I smiled at
      finding this in Dulcet's library, for I knew that the agent rather prided
      himself on being something of a gourmet, and I was reading the essays of
      the jovial French epicure with a good deal of relish when the telephone
      rang. I went to it with that slight feeling of embarrassment one always
      has in answering someone else's phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise, it was Dulcet's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That you, Ben? Listen, I want you to come round to
      Digby's right away,&rdquo; and he gave the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking he had arranged a chance for me to meet Digby (I had long wanted
      to do so), I felt hesitant about intruding; but he repeated his message
      rather sharply. &ldquo;Please come at once,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's important.&rdquo; Again he
      gave the street number, made me promise to come immediately, and rang off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly half-past ten, and the streets were fairly quiet as I walked
      briskly along. The house was one of a row of old cocoa-coloured stone
      dwellings, and evidently someone was watching for me, for while I was
      trying to read the numbers a door opened and from a dark hall an arm
      beckoned to me. I went up the tall steps and a stout woman, who seemed to
      be in some agitation, whispered my name interrogatively. &ldquo;Is this Mr.
      Trovato?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third floor front,&rdquo; she said, and I creaked quietly up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tapped at the front room on the top floor, and Dulcet opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness you're here, Ben,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Something has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a large, comfortable room, crowded with books on three walls,
      furnished with easy chairs and a couch in one corner. A brilliant blaze of
      light from several bulbs under a frosted hood poured upon a reading table
      in the middle of the room. Sitting at this table, in a Windsor chair,
      slumped down into the seat, was a short stout man whose head lolled
      sideways over his chest. He was wearing a tweed suit and a soft shirt, and
      looked as though he had fallen asleep at his work. In front of him were
      some books and a can of tobacco. I recognized him, of course, from the
      photographs I had often seen. It was Digby.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Dulcet, aghast. But, as always at such moments, what was
      uppermost in my mind was something trivial and irrelevant. I had an
      intense desire to open a window. The air in that room was thick and foggy,
      a sort of close, strangling frowst of venomously strong tobacco and
      furnace gas. After the clear elixir of the wintry night it was loathsome.
      It was the typical smell that hangs about the rooms of literary bachelors,
      who work all day long in a room without ever thinking of airing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He's dead. Pretty awful, isn't it? I found him like this
      when I got here. No sign of injury as far as I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something profoundly dreadful in this first sight, as mere
      sagging clay, of the brilliant and powerful writer whose books I had so
      long admired, and whom I had thought of as one of the strong and fortunate
      few who shape human perplexities to their own ends. I looked down at him
      with a miserable blackness in my spirit, and laid a hand on Dulcet's
      shoulder in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've sent for a doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before he comes I want to get all the
      information I can from the landlady. I wanted to have you here as a
      witness. I haven't touched anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman had followed me upstairs, and stood crying quietly in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Mrs. Barlow,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;Now please tell us everything you
      can about where Mr. Digby went this evening, and anything that has
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barlow, who seemed to be a good-hearted, simple-minded creature,
      snuffled wretchedly. &ldquo;Oh, dear, oh dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was such a nice
      gentleman, too. Let me see, he went out about seven, I suppose for his
      supper, but he was always irregular about his meals, you never could tell,
      sometimes he would eat in the middle of the afternoon, and sometimes not
      till late at night. I always would urge him that he would die of
      indigestion, but he was so kind-hearted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know where he went?&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;Perhaps he went round to the
      laundry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for he had a parcel with him, which I took to be his
      laundry because he usually took it out on Monday evenings because by that
      time the clean shirt he put on on Sunday was ready to go to the wash. I
      hate to think that in all the years he lived in this house his laundry was
      the only thing we ever had a difference about, because I used to have it
      done in the house for him but he said my washwoman tore the buttons off
      his shirts or collars or something, so a little while ago he started
      taking his things out to be done, but I don't know where because he used
      to call for them himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't any idea where he used to eat?&rdquo; insisted Dulcet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir, he liked to go different places, you know yourself how he
      was always a bit queer and concentric and he never talked much about where
      he went, but always so nice and considerate. Oh, he <i>was</i> a fine
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barlow, plainly much grieved, wept anew. &ldquo;Please try to tell us
      everything you can think of,&rdquo; said Dulcet, gently. &ldquo;What time did he come
      in, and did you notice anything unusual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing out of the way that I can think of, but then I was down in the
      basement most of the evening, for I let my maid go to the movies and I had
      a deal to do. I suppose he went along Amsterdam Avenue, he was always
      strolling up and down Amsterdam or Columbus, poor man, getting ideas for
      his literature I guess. He came back about nine o'clock I should say,
      because I heard the door about then. Just a few minutes before he came in
      there was a man came to the door with a tin of tobacco for him, which he
      said Mr. Digby had ordered sent around, and I took it up and put it on his
      table, there it is now, poor man, Carter's Mixture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barlow pointed to the tin of Cartesian Mixture that stood on the
      table. Evidently it had only just been opened, for it was practically
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;Here's his pipe lying on the floor under his chair.&rdquo;
       He picked up the briar and glanced at it. &ldquo;Only just begun to smoke it,
      for the tobacco is hardly burned. He must have been smoking when he....
      There wasn't anything else you can think of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman dried her eyes with her apron. &ldquo;There was just one other thing I
      noticed, but I suppose it's silly. But I took note of it special, because
      I thought I had heard it before, lately. While he was out, and a little
      before the man brought the tin of tobacco, I heard a sharp tapping out on
      the street in front of the house. I noticed it special, because I thought
      at first it was someone rapping on the door, and I wondered if the bell
      was out of order again, but when I went I couldn't see any one. But I
      wondered about it because I heard it two or three times, a sharp kind of
      tapping, it sounded some way like hitting on stone with a stick of some
      sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dulcet and I looked at each other rather blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after that,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I didn't think about anything one way or
      another till you came in and I told you to go right up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a clear peal from the front door bell. &ldquo;That's the doctor,&rdquo; said
      Dulcet, and Mrs. Barlow hurried downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never seen any one so brisk and matter of fact as that physician,
      and after his arrival the affair seemed to pass out of Dulcet's hands into
      the painful official machinery that takes charge in such events. Dulcet,
      acting as the dead writer's literary representative, went into the
      adjoining room, which was Digby's study, to look over the papers in the
      desk for any manuscripts that he ought to take care of. He wrote out a
      list of friends and relatives for me to send telegrams to and I went out
      to attend to this. I don't know how they get wind of these affairs, but
      the reporters were already beginning to arrive when I left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, and for several days afterward, the papers all carried long
      stories about poor Digby's brilliant career. Then the literary weeklies
      took it up. At the libraries and bookshops everyone was asking for his
      books, and I have never seen a more depressing illustration of the
      familiar fact that a writer's real fame never comes until it is too late
      to do him any good. Editors and people who had hardly been aware of
      Digby's genius while he was alive now praised him fluently, speaking of
      him as &ldquo;America's most honest realist,&rdquo; and all that sort of thing.
      Moving-picture people began inquiring about the film rights of his novels.
      Some of the sensational newspapers tried to play up his death as a mystery
      story, but the physicians asserted heart failure as the cause, and this
      aspect of the matter soon subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except at the funeral, which was attended by a great many literary people,
      I did not see Dulcet for some days. I gathered from what I read in the
      news that Digby's will had appointed him executor of his literary
      property, and I knew that he must have much to attend to. But one
      afternoon the telephone rang, and Dulcet asked me if I could knock off
      work and come round to see him. As I was living up town at that time, it
      only took me a few minutes to go round to his apartment. I found him
      smoking a pipe as usual, and looking pale and fagged. He welcomed me with
      his affectionate cordiality, and I sat down to hear what was on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me if I'm a little upset,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've just had an
      interview with a ghoul. A fellow came in to see me who had heard that I
      have a number of poor Digby's books and manuscripts. He wanted to buy them
      from me, offered big prices for them. He said that since Digby's death all
      his first editions and so on have gone up enormously in value. Apparently
      he expected me to do trading over the dead body of a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smoked awhile in silence, and then said: &ldquo;Sorry not to have seen you
      sooner, but to tell the truth I've had my hands full. His brother, who was
      the nearest kin, couldn't come from Ohio on account of serious illness,
      and everything fell on me. I had to pack up all his things and ship them,
      all that sort of business. But I've been wanting to talk to you about it,
      because I'm convinced there was something queer about the whole affair.
      I'm not satisfied with that heart-failure verdict. That's absurd. There
      was nothing wrong with his heart that I ever heard of. It's very
      unfortunate that for the first few days I was too occupied with urgent
      matters to be able to follow up the various angles of the affair. But I've
      been turning it over in my mind, and I've got some ideas I'd like to share
      with you. You remember what I told you, with unfortunate levity, about the
      secret of detective work being ability to notice the unsuspected rhymes in
      events? Well, there are one or two features of this affair that seem to me
      to rhyme together in a very sinister fashion. Wait a minute until I put on
      my other coat, and we'll go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into his bedroom. I had not liked to interrupt him, but I was
      yearning for a smoke, for leaving my rooms in a hurry I had forgotten to
      bring my pouch with me. On his mantelpiece I saw a tin of tobacco, and
      began to fill my pipe. To my surprise, just as I was taking out a match he
      darted out of the bedroom, uttered an exclamation, and snatched the briar
      from my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said, bluntly, &ldquo;but you mustn't smoke that. It's something
      very special.&rdquo; He opened his penknife, scraped out the weed I had put in
      the bowl, and carefully put it back in the tin. He took the tin and locked
      it in his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try some of this,&rdquo; he said, handing his pouch. I concluded that the
      tension of the past days had troubled his nerves. This rudeness was so
      unlike him that I knew there must be some explanation, but he offered
      none. As we went down in the elevator he said: &ldquo;The question is, can you
      make a rhyme out of tobacco and collar buttons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, a little peevishly. &ldquo;And I don't believe any one could,
      except Edward Lear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that's what we've got to do. And don't imagine that
      it's merely a nonsense rhyme, any more than Lear's were. Edward Lear was
      as great as King Lear, in his own way.&rdquo; He led me to Eighty-second Street.
      The December afternoon was already dark as we approached Mrs. Barlow's
      house. At the foot of her front steps he halted and turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your pipe going?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, irritably. &ldquo;It's out. And I haven't any tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be surly, old chap; I'll give you some if you'll tell me what you
      do when your pipe goes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you idiot,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I do this.&rdquo; And I knocked out the ashes by
      striking the bowl smartly against the palm of my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But some people do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and rapped his pipe against the stone ramp of the steps, with
      a clear, sharp, hollow sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a good way to break a nice pipe,&rdquo; I was remarking, when the basement
      door of the house flew open, and Mrs. Barlow darted out into the sunken
      area just below the pavement level. In the pale lemon-coloured glare of a
      near-by street lamp we could see that she was strongly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Is it Mr. Dulcet? Oh, sir, you did give me a
      turn. Oh, dear, that was just the tapping sound I heard the night poor Mr.
      Digby died. What was it? Did you hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like this?&rdquo; said Dulcet, knocking his pipe again on the stone step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was it, exactly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What a fright, to be sure! Was it only
      someone knocking his pipe like that? Oh, dear, it did bring back that
      horrid evening, just as plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for the mysterious death rap,&rdquo; said Dulcet as we walked back
      toward Amsterdam Avenue. &ldquo;I can't claim much ingenuity for that, however.
      You see, the morning after Digby's death I went round to Mrs. Barlow's
      early, before she had been out to sweep her pavement. The first thing I
      noticed, by the lowest step, was a little dottle of tobacco such as falls
      from a halfsmoked pipe when it is knocked out. That seemed to me to make a
      perfect couplet with Mrs. Barlow's tale of the tapping she had heard. She
      heard it several times, you remember, in a short space of time. That
      suggests to me someone standing on the street, or walking up and down, in
      a state of nervousness, because he didn't smoke any of his pipes through.
      When they were only half smoked he knocked them out, in sheer impatience.
      Was he waiting for someone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was Digby himself?&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Because, in the first place, nervousness was the last thing I would
      associate with his temperament, which was calm and collected in the
      extreme. And also, he always smoked Brown Eyed Blend, and had done so for
      years. That was the first thing that struck me as unusual the night we
      were there&mdash;that tin of Cartesian on the table. He was a man of fixed
      habits; why should he have made a change just that night? I picked up the
      little wad of tobacco I found lying on the step, and took it carefully
      home. It's Cartesian, or I'm a Dutchman. So item I in our criminal
      rhyme-scheme is: Find me a nervous man smoking Cartesian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a bit fanciful,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But crime is a fanciful thing. Ever let the
      fancy roam, as Keats said. What the deuce is the line that follows?
      Suppose we stroll down Amsterdam Avenue and find a new place to have
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Digby,&rdquo; he said, as we walked along admiring the lighted caves
      of the shopwindows. &ldquo;How he enjoyed all this. You know, there is a certain
      honest simplicity about Amsterdam Avenue's merchandising that is pleasant
      to contemplate after the shining sophistications of Broadway. In a
      Broadway delicatessen window you'll see such horrid luxuries as jars of
      cocks' combs in jelly; whereas along here the groceries show candid and
      heartening signs such, as this: 'Coming Back to The Old Times, 17c lb.
      Sugar.' Amsterdam Avenue shopkeepers speak with engaging directness about
      their traffic; for instance, there's a barber at the corner of
      Eighty-first Street who embosses on his window the legend: 'Yes, We Do
      Buster Brown Hair Cutting.' That sort of thing is very humane and genuine,
      that's why Digby was so fond of it. There's a laundry along here somewhere
      that I have often noticed; it calls itself the Fastidious Laundry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of laundries,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what do you think of this?&rdquo; We stopped,
      and I pointed to a neatly lettered placard in a window which had caught my
      eye. It said:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Notice to Artists and Authors</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>We Sew Buttons on Soft Collars Free of Charge</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there's a laundry that has the right idea. I think
      I'll bring my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I broke off when I saw my companion's face. He was leaning forward toward
      the pane, and his eyes were bright but curiously empty, as though in some
      way the mechanism of sight had been reversed, and he was looking inward
      rather than out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very odd,&rdquo; he said, presently. &ldquo;I've been up and down this street
      many times, but I never noticed that sign before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and marched into the shop, and I followed. In the soft steamy
      air several girls were ironing shirts, and a plump, pink-cheeked Hebrew
      stood behind a counter wrapping up bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed your sign in the window,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;What do you charge for
      laundering soft collars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five cents each, but we mend them, too, and sew on the buttons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good idea,&rdquo; said Dulcet, genially. &ldquo;I wish I'd known that
      before; I'd have brought my collars round to you. How long have you been
      doing that? I often go by here, but I never saw the sign before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only about a week,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;Let's see&mdash;a week ago last
      Monday I put that sign up. You wouldn't believe how much new trade it has
      brought in. I thought it would be a kind of a joke&mdash;the man next door
      suggested it, and I put it in to please him. But 'most everybody wears
      soft collars nowadays, and it seems good business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man next door?&rdquo; said Dulcet, in a casual tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, the cigar store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his name Stork?&rdquo; said Dulcet, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stork? Why, no, Basswood. What do you mean, Stork?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Dulcet, slowly, &ldquo;does he ever stand on one leg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit your kidding,&rdquo; cried the laundryman, annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, I do not trifle,&rdquo; said Dulcet, gravely. &ldquo;I'll bring you in
      some collars to fix up for me. Much obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went out again, and my companion stood for a moment in front of the
      laundry window, looking thoughtfully at the sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you ponder, old son,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I'll run into Mr. Stork-Basswood's
      and get some tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized my arm in a firm and painful clutch and whispered, &ldquo;Look at the
      corner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laundry was the second shop from the corner. Under the lamp-post at
      the angle of the street I saw, to my amazement, a man standing balanced on
      one leg. Directly under the light, he was partly in shadow, and I could
      only see him in silhouette, but the absurd profile of his onelegged
      attitude afflicted me with a renewed sense of absurdity and irritation.
      Dulcet, I thought, had evidently suffered some serious stroke in the
      region of his wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, softly, &ldquo;can you see any rhyme between soft collars and
      standing on one leg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, we both started, for somewhere near us on the street there
      sounded a sharp tapping, a ringing hollow wooden sound. Evidently it came
      from the one-legged man. This was too much for my composure. I broke away
      from Dulcet and ran to the corner. As I got there the one-legged creature
      put down a concealed limb and stood solidly on two feet, in a state of
      normalcy, as an eminent statesman would say. I was confused, and said
      angrily to the man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you mustn't stand like that, on the public street you know, on one
      leg. It's setting a bad example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my amazement he made no retort whatever, but turned and scuttled
      hastily down the avenue, disappearing in the crowds that were doing their
      evening marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Dulcet, calmly, coming up to me, &ldquo;you shouldn't
      have done that. You've very nearly spoilt it all. Come on, let's go in and
      get your tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basswood's proved to be one of those interesting combination tobacco,
      stationery, toy, and bookshops which are so common on the upper West Side.
      I have often noticed that these places are by no means unfruitful as
      hunting ground for books, because the dealers are wholly ignorant of
      literature and sometimes one may find on their shelves some forgotten
      volume that has been there for years, and which they will gladly part with
      for a song. A good many of these stores have, tucked away at the back, a
      shabby stock of circulating library volumes that have come down through
      many changes of proprietorship. Only the other day I saw in just such a
      place first editions of Kenneth Grahame's &ldquo;The Golden Age&rdquo; and Arthur
      Machen's &ldquo;The Three Impostors,&rdquo; which the storekeeper was delighted to
      sell for fifteen cents each.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dark young man was behind the tobacco counter, and from him I got a
      packet of my usual blend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Basswood in?&rdquo; said Dulcet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just stepped out,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lit our pipes and looked round the shop, glancing at the magazines and
      the queer miscellany of books. As it was approaching Christmas time there
      was a profuse assortment of those dreadful little bibelots that go by the
      name of &ldquo;gift books,&rdquo; among which were the usual copies of &ldquo;Recessional&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Vampire,&rdquo; Thoreau's &ldquo;Friendship,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ballads of a Cheechako,&rdquo; bound
      in what the trade calls &ldquo;padded ooze&rdquo;. I was particularly heartened to
      observe that one of these atrocities, called &ldquo;As a Man Thinketh,&rdquo; was
      described on the box (for all such books come in little cardboard cases)
      as being bound in antique yap. This pleased me so much that I was about to
      call it to Dulcet's attention, when I saw that he was looking at me from
      the rear of the store with a spark in his eye. I approached and found that
      he was staring at a doorway partly concealed by a pile of Christmas toys
      and novelties. Over this door was a sign: J. Basswood, Rare Book
      Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we go in and look at the rare books?&rdquo; said Dulcet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Help yourself. The boss'll be back
      soon, if you want to buy anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Basswood was evidently a man of some literary discretion. To our
      amazement we found, in a dark little room lined with shelves, a judicious
      assortment of modern books, several hundred volumes, and all first
      editions or autographed copies. The prices were marked in cipher, so we
      could not tell whether there were any bargains among them, but I know that
      I saw several particularly rare and desirable things which I would have
      been glad to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; I said to Dulcet, &ldquo;friend Basswood is a real collector.
      There isn't a thing here that isn't of prime value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was staring at a shelf in the corner, and I went over to see what he
      had found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;look at the Digbies! Not merely one copy of
      each, but three or four! This man must have specialized in Digbies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; said Dulcet, &ldquo;but he has three of 'The Autogenesis of a
      Novelist', the first thing that Digby wrote. It was privately printed, and
      afterward suppressed. It's devilish rare; even I haven't got a copy. I
      wish I knew what prices he asks for these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Perhaps this will tell us.&rdquo; I picked up one of a
      pile of pamphlets that were lying in a large sheet of wrapping paper in a
      corner of the room. It was evidently a new catalogue of Mr. Basswood's
      rare books, that had just come from the printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; I said, turning over the leaves. &ldquo;Look at this.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <i>Special Note</i>

      <i>Fine Collection of Digbiana: J. Basswood wishes to call particular
      attention to the Digbiana listed below. Anticipating the growing interest

      pains to gather a stock of first editions and presentation copies which is

      Dulcet seized the catalogue and ran his eye down the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Girlhood,' first edition, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1901, $100,&rdquo; he
      read. &ldquo;'The Nuisance of Being Loved,' first edition, $75. 'The Princess
      Quarrelsome,' $90. 'The Anatomy of Cheerfulness,' autographed copy, $150.
      'Distemper,' acting copy, signed by the author and Richard Mansfield,
      $200.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he cried, shrilly, &ldquo;this is madness! I am in touch with all the
      dealers in this sort of thing, and I know the proper prices. This man has
      multiplied them by ten.&rdquo; He thrust the catalogue into his pocket and
      glared round at the musty shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's due to poor Digby's death,&rdquo; I said. I saw that Dulcet was
      overwrought, and suggested that we go out and get some supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A good idea. I know a place on Broadway where we can
      get some guinea pigs.&rdquo; He strode out of the store and I followed,
      wondering what next. He seized my arm and hurried me along Seventy-ninth
      Street to Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the clarid blue of the evening that blazing gully of light seemed to
      foam and bubble with preposterous fire. Chop suey restaurants threw out
      crawling streamers of red and yellow brilliance; against the peacock green
      of the western sky the queer church at the corner of Seventy-ninth, with
      the oriental pinnacle and truncated belfry rising above its solid Baptist
      wings, seemed like the offspring of some reckless marriage of two
      infatuated architects, one Jewish and one Calvinist. It was a fitting
      silhouette, I thought, congruent with an evening of such wild humours.
      Guinea pigs for supper, how original and enlivening! &ldquo;Are guinea pigs
      properly kosher?&rdquo; I asked, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dulcet paid no heed, but, holding my arm, urged me along the pavement to
      an animal shop on the western side of Broadway. The window was full of
      puppies and long-haired cats. All down the aisle of the establishment were
      tiers of birdcages, covered with curtains while the birds slept. In lucid
      bowls persevering goldfish pursued their glittering and improfitable
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those guinea pigs I ordered,&rdquo; said Dulcet to the man, &ldquo;are they ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready, sir,&rdquo; he said, and took out a cage from under the counter.
      &ldquo;Very fine pigs, sir, strong and hearty; they will stand a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, with a wild desire to shout with laughter. &ldquo;But will they
      stand being eaten? They will find that rather trying, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dulcet tapped his forehead, and the dealer smiled indulgently. My
      companion took the cage, paid some money, and sped outdoors again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no further comment and in a few minutes we were in Dulcet's
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no kitchenette here, have you?&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Or do we devour
      them raw? Oh, I see, you have a camp oven. How ingenious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had put on the table a large tin box. With complete seriousness he now
      produced a small spirit lamp, over which he fitted a little basket of fine
      wire mesh. When the flame of the lamp was lit, it played upon the basket,
      which was supported by legs at just the right height. He now put the
      unsuspecting guinea pigs into the tin box, which was shaped like a
      rural-free-delivery letter-box, with a hinged door opening at one end. He
      took the spirit lamp with its attached basket and pushed the contraption
      carefully into the box with the pigs. Then he opened both windows in the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Like those much-advertised cigarettes, they
      will be toasted. But won't it take a long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be an ass,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to his desk, and took out the tin of Cartesian Mixture he had
      snatched away from me earlier in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mention of those cigarettes is apt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for in this case also
      the fuel is tobacco. Please go over by the window, and stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I watched, somewhat impressed by the gravity of his manner. From the tin
      of tobacco he took a small pinch of mixture and carefully placed it in the
      mesh basket above the lamp. Reaching into the box, he lit the wick of the
      lamp with a match, and hastily clapped to the hinged lid. The guinea pigs
      seemed to be awed by these proceedings, for they remained quiet. Dulcet
      joined me at the window, and remarked that fresh air was a fine thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We waited for about five minutes, while the guinea-pig oven stood quietly
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dulcet, finally, &ldquo;we ought to be able to see whether it
      rhymes or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched open the door of the tin box, and skipped away from it in a
      way that seemed to me perfectly insane. He picked up a pair of tongs from
      the fireplace, and standing at a distance, lifted out the lamp. The
      tobacco was smoking strongly in its mesh basket. Holding the lamp away
      from him with the tongs, he carried it into the bathroom, and I heard him
      turn on the water. Then, coming back, he inserted the tongs into the tin
      box, and gingerly withdrew first one guinea pig and then the other. Both
      were calm as possible, quite dead. Looking over the sill to see that the
      pavement was clear, he threw the tin box into the street, where it fell
      with a crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely they're not cooked already?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't heard from the doctor yet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but he promised to ring
      me up this evening. I'm awfully sorry to have delayed your dinner, old
      man. Meet me at the Lucerne grill room, Seventy-ninth and Amsterdam
      Avenue, to-morrow evening at seven o'clock and we'll eat together. You've
      been a great help to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the doctor is a mental specialist,&rdquo; I said; but he pushed me
      gently out of the room. &ldquo;We'll finish our rhyme at dinner to-morrow
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went out into the night, and sorrowfully visited a Hartford Lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening I was at the Lucerne grill promptly. This modest chop
      house was one of Dulcet's favourite resorts, and I found him already
      sitting in one of the alcoves studying the menu. He was in fine spirits,
      and his quizzical blue eyes shone with a healthy lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you armed?&rdquo; he said, mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;are we going to do some more guinea pigs to death? It
      was cruel. I have scruples against taking innocent lives. Besides, your
      experiment proved nothing. Those pigs would have died anyway, shut up in
      an air-tight box like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The box was not hermetic. I had left small apertures:
      there was plenty of oxygen. No, it was not the confinement in the tin box
      that killed them. After you had gone, the chemist whom I had consulted
      called me up. My suspicions were sound. Have you ever heard of fumacetic
      acid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is going to be terrible, I thought to myself, and ordered tenderloin
      steak, well done, with a double order of hashed brown potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard of fumacetic acid?&rdquo; he repeated, relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a deadly and little-known drug,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which (so the chemist
      tells me) possesses the property that when vaporized the slightest whiff
      of it causes instant death if inhaled into the lungs. The tobacco in that
      tin had been doctored with it. I sent the chemist the pipe that poor Digby
      was smoking when he died, and he analyzed what was left in the bowl. There
      is no doubt whatever. He was poisoned in that way. I tell you, my
      professional duty as a literary agent requires that in my clients'
      interest I should sift this thing to the bottom. It may explain some of
      those earlier deaths that baffled the Authors' League.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mrs. Carboy, surely, did not smoke,&rdquo; I was about to say; but I
      checked myself in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dove,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are superb. But I wish you would tell me how you
      worked the thing out. What was it that first aroused your suspicions? If
      it had not been for you, I should never have guessed anything wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, grimly, &ldquo;it was that murderous placard in the
      laundry window, and that is to your credit, for you noticed it. That was
      the one thing that made plain the whole complicated business. Naturally I
      suspected the tobacco from the first, for (as I told you) it was a mixture
      that Digby never smoked ordinarily. But when I heard that that eccentric
      and damnable placard had been put there at the suggestion of the
      tobacconist next door, and then found that the tobacconist was also a
      bookseller, I knew the worst. I have spent to-day in rounding up the
      threads, and I think I may say without vainglory that the miscreant is in
      my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the man standing on one leg?&rdquo; I said, puzzled. &ldquo;What was he up to,
      and why did he run?&rdquo; Dulcet's face shone with quiet triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to look for a nervous man smoking Cartesian
      Mixture. That tobacconist, Basswood, smokes Cartesian. It is a very moist,
      sticky blend, as you know. It can only be shaken out of the pipe, after
      smoking, by vigorously knocking the bowl on something hard. Very well, and
      if there is no stone step or something of that sort handy, what will a
      smoker tap his pipe on? Why, he will stand on one leg and knock it out on
      the lifted heel of the other. And his running away when you addressed him
      so whimsically, wasn't that a pretty good sign of nervousness&mdash;and
      also of a guilty and doubtful spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished his tumbler of the near-beer that has made Milwaukee infamous,
      and leaned forward earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that that laundryman would never have
      thought of his grotesque notice, addressed to 'Artists and Authors', if
      someone hadn't suggested it to him. Obviously he was only a gull. That
      card was intended as a decoy, to lure Digby away from his room, so that
      Basswood could leave the poisoned tobacco for him. Basswood had studied
      Digby's habits, and must have known that the notice about the collars
      would be sure to catch his eye. Now we had better be going. The police
      will be at Basswood's shop at eight o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could have done with a little strong coffee, but he haled me out of the
      restaurant, and we walked up Amsterdam Avenue. How little, I reflected,
      did the passersby, hurrying about their kindly and innocent concerns,
      suspect our dark and perilous errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The motive, of course,&rdquo; said Dulcet, &ldquo;was to profit by the increase of
      value Digby's death would give to his literary work. You will see a proof
      of that in a moment. Here we are. Come on, this is no time to hang back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode into the brightly lighted shop, and I followed with a clumsy
      assumption of carelessness. I must confess that my eye wandered in search
      of suitable cover in case there should be any gun play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Basswood was behind his counter, smoking a battered-looking briar. One
      side of the bowl was worn down nearly half an inch (from repeated knocking
      out on stone steps, I suppose). He was a fat, cross-looking person, with a
      black jut of moustache and a small, vindictive eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend told me about your bookshop,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;He said that you
      sometimes buy books and manuscripts and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sometimes,&rdquo; said Basswood, without enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an unpublished story of Kenelm Digby's,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;It is about
      forty pages of manuscript. What would you give for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dealer's eyes brightened. He took his pipe from his mouth, and knocked
      it out smartly on his heel, tramping on the glowing cinders. Dulcet looked
      at me gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; Basswood said, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't got it with me. But give me an idea what it would be worth to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is genuine, and characteristic of Digby's genius,&rdquo; said Basswood,
      slowly, &ldquo;I would give you two hundred dollars for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;It isn't worth half that. I would not dream of
      selling it for more than seventy-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basswood looked startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you are not in touch with the market for such things,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;There is more interest among collectors in Digby's work than in any other
      recent writer. Perhaps you don't realize what a difference his sad death
      has made in the prices of his editions. It is very regrettable, but the
      death of a writer of that kind always puts a premium on collectors' items,
      because there will never be any more of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Dulcet, politely. &ldquo;It is his death that has made the
      difference, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I suppose this manuscript <i>is</i> worth more than I
      thought. By the way, I think the title of it will interest you. It is
      called 'The Mystery of the Soft Collars' and deals with a murder that took
      place on Eighty-second Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I couldn't help admiring the glorious nonchalance with which Dulcet made
      this remark, gazing the dealer straight in the eye. Basswood's face was a
      study, and his cheek was pale and greasy. But he, too, was a man of
      considerable nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it's genuine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That doesn't sound to me like
      Digby's style.&rdquo; His voice shook a little, and he added: &ldquo;However, if it's
      as interesting as it sounds, I might pay even more than two hundred for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rascal!&rdquo; shouted Dulcet. &ldquo;Do you think you can buy me off? No! keep
      your hands above the counter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had whipped out his revolver, and held it at the man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Basswood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even the cleverest of us make
      mistakes. Let me call your attention to one thing. If it was Digby's death
      that made the difference in the values of his books, how is it that this
      bill from your printer, for that new catalogue of yours, is dated ten days
      before Digby died? I picked it up in your back room the other day. Doesn't
      that seem to show that you knew, ten days before the event, that there was
      going to be a sudden boom in Digbiana? Ten days before he died you were
      multiplying the prices of the items you had gathered. Now, you dog, can
      you explain that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basswood shook, but still he clung to his hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you a thousand for that manuscript,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; said Dulcet to me, &ldquo;just slip around the corner and whistle three
      times. The police are waiting on Eighty-fifth Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's still one thing that puzzles me,&rdquo; I said to Dulcet late that
      night as we sat in his room for a final smoke. &ldquo;I remember that before we
      discovered that sign in the laundry you said that what we needed to do was
      to find a rhyme between tobacco and collar buttons. Now what the deuce
      started you off on collar buttons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I had to pack up poor old Digby's belongings,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had the
      sad task of going through his bureau drawers. You know the devilish little
      buttons that the manufacturers insist on putting on soft collars. They
      always come off after one or two washings, and then the collar collapses
      round your neck into an object of slovenly reproach. Digby was a bachelor,
      and there was no one to do any mending for him. And when I found that
      every one of his soft collars had its little button neatly sewed on, I
      knew there was something wrong. I ask you, wouldn't that have aroused the
      alarm of the least suspicious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to the present time, as far as I know, Basswood remains the only
      bookseller who has ever been electrocuted.

    <h2>
      GLORIA AND THE GARDEN OF SWEDEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS one of those
      gilded October days when the serene sunshine is as soft and tawny as
      candle-light; when the air is thin and sharp in the early mornings, but
      the noontime is as comfortably genial as the radiance of a hearth reddened
      with hickory embers. Dove Dulcet and I were strolling along Riverside
      Park, enjoying the blue elixir of the afternoon, in which there was just a
      faint prick, a gently tangible barb of the coming arrows of the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winter sharpens her spearheads,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; was my reply. Below
      us I saw the coaling-station at the Seventy-ninth Street pier. &ldquo;The
      merriest music the householder can hear nowadays is the roar of coal going
      down the chute into the cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and seemed touched by a sudden melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that coal-dump reminds me of Gloria Larsen. Did I ever
      tell you about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Coal, I presume, made you think of diamonds; and
      diamonds, of Miss Larsen. Were you engaged to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have been,&rdquo; he said, sentimentally. Before us was an empty bench,
      on a little knoll that looks out over the shining sweep of the river. I
      drew him to it, and we filled our pipes. When you can get a minor poet in
      an autobioloquacious mood, it is well to encourage him. No one takes life
      so seriously as the minor poet, and consequently his memoirs make fine
      sport for the disinterested bystander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, blowing a waft of tobacco smoke into the soft, sun-brimmed
      air, and settling down into the curve of the bench. &ldquo;The association was
      even more obvious than that of coal and diamonds. I always think of Gloria
      when winter begins to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She was cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meditated, ignoring my jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a good many years ago,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;before you knew me. When
      I first came to town, you know, I had a fine ambition to be a writer. I
      had just a little money, so I shut myself up in a hall room at the top of
      a cheap lodging-house on Seventy-fifth Street, hired a typewriter, and set
      about to butt my bead against all the walls that hem in the beginner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was one of those old four-story dwellings that are now mostly
      boarding-houses, and it was run by a good-hearted widow who would let her
      rooms only to men, because she said they were less trouble than women. Her
      house was clean and incredibly cheap, and almost all the lodgers were
      young fellows like myself&mdash;students, or starveling artists, or chaps
      with literary ambitions. That was how I had heard of the place, through
      another fellow who lived there and had built up a little sort of coterie
      in the house. He was Black-more. You know his name; he gave up art long
      ago. He's now the art editor of the <i>Mother, Home, and Heaven Magazine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Vesey, our landlady, was quite a character. I was always rather a
      favourite with her, because the very first day I came to her house I
      happened to find her cat, which had wandered away some days before,
      leaving her disconsolate. The cat's name, I remember, was Nemo. She had
      called it so because, with that admirable virginity of mind that one finds
      only in a childless married woman, she was uncertain of the animal's sex.
      Anyway, it was a fine big creature, and the apple of Mrs. Vesey's pie. She
      talked so much about it that we used to chaff her a good deal on the
      subject, and say that we thought it was going to have kittens, and all
      that sort of thing. Blackmore used to say, remembering the title of some
      idiotic melodrama he had seen, that it was 'Neither Maid, Wife, nor
      Widow.' He was right, for it was the kind of cat that is not likely to be
      either a father or a mother without a miracle. But I don't want to be
      indelicate. I only mention Nemo because it was through him that I first
      talked with Gloria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first day I was at Mrs. Vesey's I heard her groaning about the
      vanished cat. That evening I went out to supper, feeling rather lonely,
      and dropped in at an eccentric-looking little restaurant on Amsterdam
      Avenue. It was called Larsen's Physical Culture Chophouse, and I have
      never seen a more amusing place. Old man Larsen was a Swede, and all the
      Scandinavian fads ran riot in his head&mdash;vegetarian food, for
      instance. He didn't absolutely condemn meat, for he would serve it if you
      insisted, but all his joy was in weird combinations of calory, protose,
      and vitamine, or whatever those things are called. Bean &ldquo;cutlets,&rdquo; and
      protose &ldquo;steak&rdquo; that turned out, on examination, to be made of chopped
      walnuts and lentils, and the &ldquo;Thousand-Calory Combination Dinner,&rdquo; of
      which he made a specialty. When you sat down, if you were a regular
      customer, old Larsen would come round and look you over and diagnose from
      your complexion the kind and quantity of calories you needed for that
      meal, and would give you combinations of spinach croquettes and lentil pie
      that he warranted would purge the blood and compose the mind. On the walls
      were charts of Swedish exercises and systems of calisthenics, and he sold
      a little pamphlet that he himself had written telling how to be strong and
      merry and full of physique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to come back to my first visit to Larsen's restaurant. I hadn't
      been in there many minutes before I noticed the girl at the cashier's
      desk. My, my, what a girl! My table was close to her little throne, and I
      couldn't help watching her out of the end of my eye. I wondered if she was
      raised entirely on protose and lentils, for I have never seen anything so
      gloriously and vitally physical in my life. Great, bold blue eyes, and
      crisp, sparkling golden hair, and blood that spoke delicately through her
      skin, and a figure&mdash;well, just our old friend of Melos over again,
      that lively combination of grace and strength. She was just curves and
      waves and athletic softness&mdash;the kind of creature that makes your
      arms tingle, you know. No corset, I suppose. In the old man's booklet on
      physical culture he defended the gymnastic doctrine that women should
      develop what he called a muscle corset by bending and swaying from the
      hips a thousand times a day. He said it must be done&mdash;well, <i>au
      naturel</i>, in front of an open window in one's bedroom in the morning.
      I'd be ashamed to admit that we fellows at Mrs. Vesey's used to set our
      alarm clocks at half-past six to go round the corner to Amsterdam Avenue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dulcet paused a while and watched the river pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about the cat,&rdquo; I reminded him presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, that first night I was at the chop-house I noticed
      a very fine, fat cat browsing about under the tables. I was amused at the
      corpulence of the animal. I said to myself that a cat as large as that
      must surely get some meat somewhere, because, while vegetarian protose
      food may be all right for Swedes, a cat is a realist in the matter of
      carnal meals. And when I went to the desk to pay my check, wanting some
      excuse to get into talk with the superb Gloria&mdash;who was, of course,
      the old man's daughter&mdash;I remarked on the sleek, healthy appearance
      of her cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, it's not ours,' she said. 'It came in here yesterday. I don't know
      whose he is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet I know whose it is,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her that Mrs. Vesey, who ran the bachelor lodging-house on
      Seventy-Fifth Street, had lost her Nemo. She listened with interest, those
      thrilling blue eyes sizing me up in a keen, humorous way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I shouldn't wonder it's hers,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcoming any pretext for prolonging the discussion, I borrowed the phone
      at Gloria's elbow, and, studying the heart-rending curves of her chin and
      cheek and throat, I called up Mrs. Vesey and told her I thought I had
      found her pet. Mrs. Vesey hurried round to the restaurant, and swept up
      the vagabond Nemo with cries of joy into her lean and affectionate bosom.
      Nemo purred, and I escorted Mrs. Vesey home, recapitulating in my mind the
      perfect contours of the girl's heavenly form. My enthusiasm was even such
      that when the other men came in I could not refrain from telling them all
      about her. I saw that I had made a mistake, for instantly Blackmore swore
      he would get her to sit for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, from that time on, the Physical Culture Chophouse became the
      nightly haunt of our little party. The other men had seen it many times,
      but the vegetarian threats in the window had frightened them away. But
      now, none of us dared to be absent very many dinners, for fear the rest
      would gain some advantage with the girl. I cannot give you any conception
      of the humorous glamour of that time unless I insist that she was the most
      superbly luscious thing I have ever glimpsed; and one sees a good many
      covetable creatures on the streets of New York. Some of them said she was
      cold; that in spite of all the nutritious algebra printed on old Larsen's
      menus (he used to put down all sorts of preposterous formulas about
      starch, and albumen, and phosphorus, and proteids, and so on)&mdash;she
      was lacking in calories. But I know that when we sat at table, and she
      came round to ask if everything was all right, and leaned over us with her
      clear eyes, as blue as a special-delivery stamp, and that cream-white
      neck, and the faint glimmer of a blue ribbon shining through the hilly
      slopes of her blouse&mdash;&mdash;-Oh, well, Ben, we were young, and we
      ate red meat for lunch, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess old man Larsen, who spent most of his time in the kitchen,
      encouraged her to kid us along, for he never seemed to mind our open
      admiration of his daughter. He probably saw that she was a bigger business
      asset than any number of calory charts. Every now and then he would come
      out and chin with us, for our party became a nightly event in the café.
      Before long we had sampled every kind of vegetarian combination on the
      list, and had him busy inventing new ones. We used to ask him if he had
      raised a girl like that on nothing but vegetables, and he would laugh and
      swear that Gloria had never tasted blood until she was sixteen. It seemed
      queer to us that the restaurant wasn't full of her suitors. I should have
      thought, with a girl like her, they'd have been standing in line waiting
      for a look at her. I suppose that people who feed on nothing but
      vegetables are rather puny in such matters. It's an odd thing, but I've
      always noticed that most of the people who frequent these crank
      physical-culture and dietetic eating-places are a queer, sick-looking lot&mdash;youths
      with rolling Adam's apples, and sallow, soup-stained girls. Certainly our
      little gang, so very jovial and fancy-free, made a quaint contrast to most
      of the patrons of the house. In a few days we felt as if we owned the
      place, and had the old man slide two tables together just underneath
      Gloria's cash register, where we met every evening for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Larsen, he was a crank on many subjects but he was no fool. He was
      an athletic, erect fellow with a bristling gray moustache and cropped hair
      and a forcible gray eye. On the wall was a huge photo of him in a kind of
      Sandow pose, with a leopard-skin apron round his middle, showing terrific
      knotty biceps and back muscles. Gloria told us that at one time he had
      been a physical instructor in the Swedish army, and the head of a <i>Turnverein</i>,
      or something of that sort. There was a certain physical and gymnastic
      candour about him that amused us. He was awfully proud of Gloria, whom he
      had raised himself (being a widower) according to his own hygienic and
      athletic principles. After we had all bought his booklets, and promised to
      take up his system of calisthenics, he became quite chummy and showed us a
      lot of photographs of Gloria at different ages, doing her gymnastic
      exercises, beginning as a little plump Venus and ending as a stunning
      profile in tights. We tried to maintain an attitude of merely scientific
      detachment toward those pictures, admiring them only as connoisseurs of
      physical culture; but we ended by begging him for copies, insisting that
      they would be a useful guide to us in our own private exercising. But
      Larsen said he was keeping them to illustrate a new enlarged edition of
      his physical-culture book. We told him that it would sell a million
      copies, and I think we all volunteered to act as selling-agents for the
      book. Annette Kellermann and Susanna Cocroft, we cried, were scarecrows
      compared to Gloria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To all this banter Gloria would listen calmly and unembarrassed, for she
      had a magnificent unconsciousness of her own superb allure. We would each
      try to get a moment alone with her to describe the exercises we were
      taking, and to ask her advice about our muscular development. I remember
      that Blackmore, after secret practice that we had not suspected, took the
      wind out of our sails one evening when some of us were bragging of our
      accomplishment in bending and touching the floor while standing on tiptoe.
      He jumped up and caught hold of the lintel of the doorway, and chinned
      himself on it a dozen times or so. We were all crestfallen by this feat
      until Gloria came forward&mdash;all the other customers had gone home&mdash;and
      did the same thing about twenty times. She went back to her counter with a
      heavenly flush of pride, while Blackmore dashed to a table and did a
      little sketch of her from memory, with the lovely lines of her figure
      silhouetted against the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was I who was first to think of the subtlest compliment that any
      one could pay her, which was to ask the privilege of feeling her biceps.
      And what an arm she had! Not a great, fleshy, flabby washerwoman's limb,
      but the rippling marble of a Greek statue brought to warm life! Blackmore
      used to sit at meal-times neglecting his protose steak and making sketches
      of her while she wasn't looking. The best I could do was write verses
      about her. And while she played no favourites, I think she really gave me
      a little the inside track, because I talked physical culture with her more
      seriously than the others, who tried to make love to her a little too
      baldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time she had us all doing calisthenics. The creaky floors of Mrs.
      Vesey's house used to resound night and morning with the agonies of our
      gymnastics. There was one exercise that Gloria told us she found
      particularly helpful. It was to lie down with the feet under a bureau or
      any other heavy piece of furniture, extend the arms behind the head, and
      then raise and lower the body a hundred times, pivoting from the waist.
      This was only one of fifty or more laborious accomplishments that we
      undertook for the sake of our goddess. No woman was ever wooed with more
      honest pangs, or with more repeated genuflections. As we lay on the floor
      before going to bed, raising our legs in the air two hundred times, or
      groaned in some sinew-cracking, twisting contortion devised by the
      pitiless Swede, it was the vision of Gloria's beauty of snow and rose that
      gave us courage. If any passer-by ever looked up at the front of Mrs.
      Vesey's house in the early mornings, he must have been startled to see a
      white figure near every window, furiously going through the Swedish
      manual. One of us, we fondly thought, would some day spend a healthy
      Swedish honeymoon performing these motions in ecstatic company with
      Gloria; and we did not want to be shamed by her incomparable perfection.
      If she worshipped bodily symmetry, our goal was nothing less. We wanted to
      be lithe, supple, very panthers of elasticity and grace. The evening I was
      able to stand on one leg in the restaurant and proudly raise my other foot
      to touch a gas-jet some six feet from the floor, I felt that Gloria might
      some day be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dove paused again, and seemed to fall into a reminiscent reverie.
      Unconsciously he stiffly extended one leg in front of him, and I divined
      that he was inwardly rehearsing that act of calisthenic triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gracious!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I've never forgotten the night I got her father's
      permission to take her to some gymnastic tournament, or something of that
      sort, down at Madison Square Garden. How annoyed the other men were when
      they went to the chop-house that night for their evening penance of
      lentils, and found Gloria absent! Yes, it was an odd wooing. I had found
      the measurements of the Venus de Milo in some Sunday paper, and that
      night, when we became quite sentimental, I made her promise to take her
      own dimensions, so that we could compare the proportions of the two. And
      we had some very happy little jokes, quite simple ones that she would
      understand, about her arms being much more lovely than those of the
      statue, and that sort of thing. How deliciously she blushed the next day
      when she gave me her list of measurements, written out on a sheet of
      paper. Of course, I pretended not to understand which was which. I wrote a
      little poem about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you were getting on very well. What was
      the trouble? You didn't marry her, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old man Larsen,&rdquo; he continued, gravely, &ldquo;had a number of other hobbies
      besides vegetarianism and physical culture. He was a mechanical genius in
      his way. I remember once, after we had expressed exaggerated admiration of
      some atrocious compound of lentils and nuts and fruit, Gloria took us
      through the kitchen to show us an ingenious sandwich-making machine her
      father had contrived. You fed in loaves of pumpernickel bread and pats of
      nut butter on one side, hard-boiled eggs and lettuce and dressing on the
      other, and out came egg-salad sandwiches through a slot, as neat as you
      could want to see. But the best of his stunts was a sort of miniature
      vacuum cleaner which the waitresses used for taking the crumbs off the
      tables. You've seen those little hot-air pistols they use at swell
      shoe-shining stands to dry the liquid cleanser off your shoes before they
      put on the polishing paste? Well, Larsen's decrumbing machine, as we used
      to call it, looked rather like those. You screwed a plug into an electric
      light socket, ran the little gun over the table, and in a jiffy it sucked
      up crumbs and cigarette ashes and spilled lentils and matches, and left
      the cloth neat. Larsen was so proud of it he said he was going to patent
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never cared so very much for the old man, he was a little too
      eccentric; and I began to think, after a while, that he used his daughter
      a little too crudely as a business bait; but he was full of ideas. He had
      a big motor-truck that he used to cruise around town, visiting the markets
      himself, to get the pick of the vegetables; and he was always tinkering
      with that truck, planning new mechanical tricks of some kind. He had an
      insatiable curiosity, too. He used to sit down at the table with us
      sometimes, late in the evening, and ask about our work, and where we
      lived, and what Mrs. Vesey was like, and what time of day we were home,
      and all sorts of fool questions like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the time went on, and it began to be cold weather. I noticed this
      sooner than the other fellows, I think, because whereas most of them went
      to offices during the daytime, I stayed home at Mrs. Vesey's, trying to
      write in my narrow coop of a top bedroom. You know how depressing an
      instrument a typewriter is when your hands are cold. I haven't forgotten
      some dreary vigils I had up there, struggling to write short stories.
      Sometimes I used to give it up weakly, and go round to Larsen's, where it
      was always warm and cozy, to drink herb coffee and eat those brittle
      Swedish biscuits and chat with Gloria. I used to complain to her about the
      cold in my room, and she would laugh and say that I just ought to try a
      winter in Sweden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Swedish exercises,' she would say. 'That's the thing to stir up your
      blood! They'll keep you warm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, in her enchanting way, she would tell me a new one, and if
      there were no customers (as there generally weren't in the middle of the
      afternoon) she would illustrate how it should be done. Sometimes she would
      even allow me what she called a Swedish kiss&mdash;a very fleeting and
      provocative embrace. And then I would show her my new perfection in doing
      the backward stoop or some such muscular oddity, and return to my cold
      citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in spite of the fact that we were all busy much of the time going
      through our manual of exercises, presently the chill of Mrs. Vesey's
      lodgings became severe. Mrs. Vesey was a rather obstinate and frugal old
      dear, and she herself dwelt down in the kitchen, where her big gas-range
      kept her comfortable. When we complained of the cold, she had all sorts of
      excuses for postponing lighting the furnace. There was a big coal strike
      that year, and she was quite right in suspecting that once her present
      supply was exhausted it would be very hard to get more. Also, she said,
      her furnace man had quit, but she was hunting for another. On one pretext
      or another, she kept on putting us off, until finally it was mid-November,
      and we were doing our exercises in rooms where our breath showed like
      clouds of fog. And then one day Mrs. Vesey came up in great glee to say
      that a coal man had called that very morning, of his own accord, and had
      offered to give her five tons. She had promptly snapped at the chance, and
      he had put the coal in the cellar; so we should have heat the very next
      day, when the new furnace man was expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally we were all cheered by this good news. We sped round to
      Larsen's restaurant in high spirits, and adored our divinity with even
      more than usual abandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now my fingers will be warm again, Gloria,' I said, 'I'll be able to
      write some more poems about you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' cried Blackmore, 'and now it will be warm enough for you to come
      and pose for me in my lovely attic at Mrs. Vesey's. If you had come
      before, I should have called my painting &ldquo;The Chilblain Venus.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Silly boys!' said Gloria, with that delicious, soft Swedish accent which
      I can't even try to imitate. 'You are hot-blooded enough as it is. You
      don't need all that warming up. Look at us vegetarians; you make fun of
      us, but our lentils keep our blood circulating. Try Brussels sprouts; they
      are full of calories.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah!' we shouted. 'But you seem to keep this place warm enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Larsen, who passed through the room just then, broke in crossly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We have to, for the sake of the customers,' he said. 'Gloria, stop
      fooling with the gentlemen and attend to business.' He seemed in a bad
      humour that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day must have been some sort of holiday, for I know we all went
      out to see a football game. We got back about supper-time and found the
      house perishing chill. With shouts and protests we called Mrs. Vesey from
      her kitchen, but she explained that the expected furnace man had not
      turned up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' said Blackmore, 'this can't go on any longer, Mrs. Vesey. I'll go
      down and light the fire myself. We'll take turns and keep it going till
      your man comes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ran down to the basement, but a minute later he was up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mrs. Vesey,' he shouted, 'what is all this nonsense? Are you kidding us?
      There's no coal down there at all!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No coal?' she exclaimed. 'Why, there was a good three or four tons, and
      the man said he put five tons more in yesterday. I heard him do it&mdash;never
      heard such a noise in my life. I paid him ten dollars a ton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Impossible!' Blackmore cried, angrily. 'There's not enough down there to
      fry Nemo with. About three shovelfuls, that's all. What is this&mdash;some
      kind of a game to freeze us out?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Vesey wrung her hands, and we all ran down to the cellar. It was as
      Blackmore had said. The bins were empty, save for a few lumps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dove gazed down thoughtfully at the coal office on the pier below us,
      where a wagon was loading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a mellow afternoon like this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;coal doesn't seem quite so
      pressing a concern; but I tell you, in a bleak boarding-house about
      Thanksgiving time, with no heat of any sort available but a gas-jet, it is
      a different matter. We were an angry and puzzled lot that night. Mrs.
      Vesey protested so pitifully that there had been coal in the bins only the
      day before, and asserted so repeatedly that she had heard the noise of the
      new load going in, that we could not help believe her. She promised to
      call up her coal man the first thing the next morning, and we also agreed
      to go round and visit him in a body, to add our personal appeals; but how
      on earth several tons of coal could have been stolen out of the cellar
      without any one hearing it seemed to us a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next morning we visited the coal-dealer <i>en masse</i>&mdash;in a
      coalition, as Blackmore said&mdash;and by spirited imprecation and paying
      cash we extracted a promise to have a couple of tons sent at once. His
      office was some distance up on Columbus Avenue, and on our way back we
      passed through one of the cross-streets&mdash;Eighty-Third, I think it
      was, because one of us wanted to get some stamps at the post-office. As we
      came along, we heard the rumble of coal passing down a chute, and saw a
      coal-wagon in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There's somebody in luck,' said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But what an odd-looking coal-wagon,' said another, as we approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a large motor-truck with a hinged metal top, something like a huge
      street-cleaning cart. The engine was throbbing, and the coal was roaring
      noisily in the chute, which led down into the cellar window of a
      brownstone dwelling. The chute, instead of being the customary shallow
      trough, was a large circular pipe, so that we could not actually see the
      coal pouring downward, but only hear it crashing through the metal tube.
      That struck me as a good idea for preventing the coal-dust from spreading
      over everything near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we were all interested not only in the odd appearance of the truck,
      but in the extraordinary din it caused. Delivering coal is never a silent
      job, naturally; but this racket was really terrific. The driver seemed to
      have left his engine running full tilt, and the whole truck quivered and
      shook with the power. We stood amazed at the furious rattle and uproar.
      The noise was too great for spoken words to be caught, but I pointed out
      the circular chute to Blackmore. It was made in telescoping sections, to
      slide into itself, and was an interesting novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It occurred to me that this dealer, whoever he might be&mdash;there was
      no name on the truck&mdash;could perhaps let Mrs. Vesey have some coal. We
      could see the feet of the driver, who was standing on the other side of
      the truck, and I went round to speak to him. It was a stocky man with a
      flowing bush of black beard and wearing a suit of very grimy overalls. At
      the top of my voice I yelled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Got any coal to sell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shook his head in a surly way and turned his back on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not tell from his gesture whether he had answered my question, or
      was indicating that he could not hear; so I shouted at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time I noticed Blackmore and the others gathered at the
      cellar window, looking in curiously over the slope of the delivery pipe.
      The coal man seized a lever and shut off his power, for the engine
      stopped, and after a little sliding and rumbling in the tube the racket
      ceased. He picked up a shovel and ran to the group by the chute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Here, let that alone!' he cried, angrily. &ldquo;'Keep your shirt on,' said
      Blackmore. 'We're just looking at this outfit of yours. It makes a devil
      of a noise. Regular public nuisance, I call it!' '&ldquo;It's none of your
      affair,' said the man. 'Keep out of what don't concern you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He returned to his truck, pulled a handle, and the roar of the coal began
      again. I was standing near him, while the others were on the opposite side
      of the wagon, so I was the only one to see a curious thing. There were
      several revolving cogwheels at the side of the truck, and in his
      irritation, I suppose the driver stooped over them too closely. At any
      rate, his beard caught in the cogs, and I gave a cry of dismay, thinking
      he would be cruelly hurt. To my amazement the beard was whisked quickly
      from his face, and I saw that he was Larsen. He looked at me with an
      expression of alarm and anger that was laughable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'When did you turn coal-dealer?' I shouted. But at this moment Blackmore,
      who was still bending over the chute, sprang up and ran round to us. He,
      too, was staggered to see the identity of the driver. He dragged me a few
      paces away and shouted in my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Damn queer business,' he said. 'That coal isn't going in. It's coming
      out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What the deuce do you mean?' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Just what I say. He's got some sort of a suction engine in that truck, a
      kind of big vacuum cleaner, and he's simply siphoning the coal out of
      somebody's cellar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larsen ran at us with a big spanner in his hand, but we grappled with
      him, and while three of us held him the others examined the truck. It was
      perfectly true. By an ingenious gasoline pump installed in the wagon he
      was drawing out the coal. Looking into the top of the wagon through a
      little glass peephole, we could see the black nuggets coming swiftly up
      out of the chute. By this time a little crowd had gathered, and the lady
      of the house ran out to see what was happening. I think she thought we
      were trying to seduce her coal supply. She explained angrily to us that
      Larsen had driven up to her door half an hour before and offered to sell
      her several tons of coal. Her cellar, like everyone else's, was none too
      well stocked, and she had been delighted to agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we were wondering just what to do, Larsen, who had been glaring
      wickedly at us, broke away from our grasp and reversed his machinery so
      that the coal began to thunder back honestly into the cellar. The puzzled
      woman, not suspecting anything wrong, went back indoors after we made some
      impromptu explanation for the fuss. Larsen's amputated black beard whirled
      round and round, still adhering to the rolling cogs, as we watched, while
      he stood by sullenly. We walked away down the block to hold a council, and
      also to let the group of mystified onlookers disperse. Of course, our
      first thought was to go for the police; but then we thought of Gloria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dove sighed, and tapped out his long-expired pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that's pretty near the end of the story. I'm afraid
      association with Beauty blunts the sense of rectitude. No, we didn't do
      anything about it, except see to it that Larsen put back that coal in the
      cellar. I suppose we were really accessory to a misdemeanour, because we
      gathered from some small paragraphs we saw in the papers that a number of
      householders in that neighbourhood had been mysteriously robbed of their
      coal. To tell you the truth, we couldn't bear the thought of taking any
      action that would ruin Gloria's happiness. What were a few tons of black,
      filthy coal compared to that serene and golden-white beauty of hers, like
      some princess in a Norse fairy tale? The old man was a lunatic, we
      supposed, and would come to grief sooner or later. We were not going to be
      the ones to bring humiliation upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We walked back, stricken, to our lodgings; and as we passed the Physical
      Culture Chophouse we looked furtively through the window. We could see
      Gloria laying the tables for lunch, the tall, strong curve of her back as
      she leaned over, her capable white hands smoothing the cloth. None of us
      had the heart to go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We clubbed together to pay for Mrs. Vesey's new supply of coal, although
      it broke our pocket-books for the next month or so. We were too hard up,
      then, to go on eating at Larsen's. We had to patronize a lunch-counter
      instead, where we gloomed over frankfurters and beans and quarrelled with
      one another, in sheer misery, as to which one of us Gloria had really
      liked best. We never saw her again, because about a week later the Larsen
      café shut up, and they disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the calisthenics?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Did you go on with those?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we were too melancholy. Also, as soon as Mrs. Vesey's coal
      arrived, we didn't need to. That was the terrible part of it. You see,
      Gloria had simply egged us on to do those exercises so that we wouldn't
      feel the chill when her father stole the coal. I'm afraid she was as
      guilty as he was, but we tried to convince ourselves that she was only a
      tool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We got up from our bench, for the afternoon air was growing bleak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why that coal-dump down there reminded me of
      Gloria. Well, it was wonderful while it lasted&mdash;until, as you might
      say, the serpent drove us out of our Garden of Sweden.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE COMMUTATION CHOPHOUSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS two days
      before Christmas, and Dove Dulcet had come down town to have lunch with
      me. As he had arrived rather early, we were taking a little stroll round
      the bright, windy streets before our meal, enjoying the colour and
      movement of the scene. We stopped by St. Paul's churchyard to note the
      curious contrast of the old chocolate spire relieved against the huge
      glittering shaft of the Woolworth Building. At the noon hour St. Paul's
      stands in the dark shadow of the great cliffs to the south, while the
      Woolworth pinnacle leaps up like a spearhead into the golden vacancy of
      day-long sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Paul in the shadow, Saint Frank in the sun,&rdquo; said Dove with gentle
      irony. &ldquo;It seems to prove that ten cents put in the cash register gets
      nearer Heaven than ten cents dropped in the collection plate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dove is philosophical, he is always full of quaint matter, but I was
      hardly heeding what he said. My eye had been caught by a crowd gathered at
      the corner of Church Street. Over the heads of the throng was a winking
      spark of light that flashed this way and that as though spun from a
      turning mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go and see what's doing,&rdquo; I said. My poet friend is always docile,
      and he followed me down Fulton Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me like a silk hat,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was. On the corner of the pavement stood a tall, stout, and very
      well-nourished man with a ruddy face, wearing shabby but still presentable
      cutaway coat and gray trousers, and crowned by a steep and glittering
      stovepipe hat which twinkled like a heliograph in the dazzling winter
      glare. But, most amazing, when we elbowed a passage through the jocular
      crowd, we saw that this personable individual was wearing, instead of an
      overcoat, two large sandwich boards vigorously lettered as follows:
    </p>
    <h3>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This corpulent sandwich man was blithely answering the banter of those who
      were not awed by the radiance of his headgear and the dignity of his mien,
      and passing out printed cards to those nearest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do all the hundred meals have to be eaten to-day?&rdquo; asked Dulcet. &ldquo;If so,
      the task is beyond my powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the man in the Bible,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he probably rented his garments. But
      he couldn't rent that admirable abdomen that proclaims him a well-fed man.
      It seems to me a very sound ad. for the chophouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably,&rdquo; said my friend, gravely, &ldquo;he is the man who put the ad
      in adipose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sandwich man, unabashed by these remarks, handed me one of his cards,
      which Dulcet and I read together:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>K. Jefferson Gastric, the best-fed man south of 42nd Street, takes this
      importunity of urging you to become a steakholder in the Commutation
      Chophouse. Why pay for overhead expense? In the Commutation Chophouse all
      unnecessaries are discarded and you pay only for food, not for
      finger-bowls and a lovely female cashier. No tips. To-day Only, the
      Opening Day, to celebrate the jovial Yule, the management will sell Strip
      Tickets entitling you to 100 Glorious Meals, for $10.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point a policeman politely urged Mr. Gastric to move on, and he
      passed genially down Church Street, his resplendent hat glowing above a
      trail of followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it's time to eat, anyway. Let's go over to Ann Street
      and have a look at this philanthropic venture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dulcet, &ldquo;since it's your turn to buy, far be it from me to
      protest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The narrow channel of Ann Street is always crowded at the lunch hour, but
      on that occasion it was doubly congested with patrons of the amusing
      toyshops. We pushed patiently along, and passing Nassau Street moved into
      a darker and shabbier region. A sound of music rose upon the air. To our
      surprise, at the entrance to an unsuspected alley stood a fiddler playing
      a merry jig. Beside him was another sandwich man, also stout and
      well-favoured and in Fifth-Avenue attire, carrying boards which read:
    </p>
    <h3>
      ENTRANCE TO THE COMMUTATION CHOPHOUSE

    <p>
      Strip Tickets for 100 Square Meals, $10
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is highly diverting,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Apparently we go down this passage.
      Come on, everyone seems bound the same way. We won't get a seat unless we
      make haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dulcet was gazing reflectively at the sandwich boards. His blue eyes had a
      quizzical twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God, for country, and for Yule,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Queer that this should
      happen on Ann Street. I seem to remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer that it should happen anywhere,&rdquo; I interrupted him. &ldquo;It's a clever
      advertising stunt, anyway&mdash;100 meals for $10. It seems too good to be
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only thing I'm afraid of,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that it is literally true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk in, gents, give us a try,&rdquo; cried the sandwich man. &ldquo;Try anything
      once, gents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Dove,&rdquo; I said, seeing that others were crowding ahead of us down
      the alley. &ldquo;None of your paradoxes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The narrow passage turned into a courtyard overlooked by old grimy
      warehouses with iron-shuttered windows. In one corner was a fine
      substantial brick building with a rounded front, and a long flight of
      wooden stairs that seemed to lead up to a marine junk shop, for old
      sea-boots and ships' lanterns and fenders hung along the wall. In a
      basement was an iron foundry where we could see the bright glow of a
      forge. Halfway down the little area was a low door with a huge stone
      lintel-piece over which was a large canvas sign: <i>the commutation
      chophouse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I must confess to an irrational affection for quaint eating places, and
      having explored downtown New York's crowded cafés and lunchrooms rather
      carefully in quest of a congenial tavern, the Commutation Chophouse struck
      me as highly original and pleasing. We stepped down into a very large and
      rather dark cellar that apparently had previously been used as a
      carpenter's shop, for a good many traces of the earlier tenancy were still
      visible. The furnishings were of the plainest, consisting simply of heavy
      wooden tables and benches. There was no linen on the tables, but the wood
      had been scrubbed scrupulously clean and there were piles of tissue
      napkins. From a door at the back waiters came rushing with trays of food.
      A glorious clatter of knives and forks filled the air, and it looked at
      first as though we would find no place to sit. As Dove expressed it, the
      room was loaded to the muzzle; and a continuous stream of patrons was
      coming down the alley, allured by the sandwich man and the absurd thin
      gayety of the fiddle. By the front door stood a dark young man, behind a
      small counter, selling tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One meal for a dollar,&rdquo; he cried, repeatedly, as he took in money. &ldquo;One
      hundred meals for ten dollars. Get your commutation tickets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll try two single meals to begin with,&rdquo; I said, and put down a
      ten-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man rummaged in a drawer full of greasy notes to get the change.
      &ldquo;Better get a commutation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tremendous saving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you'd need a cash register,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;Handling all
      that kale, it would be useful in keeping the accounts straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked up sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;what are you, mister? Cash-register salesman? Step
      along please, don't block the gangway. Next! Seats in the rear! No,
      commutation tickets not transferable. Good only to the purchaser. Ten
      dollars, please. Next!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to be coining money,&rdquo; said Dove, as we found places at last in
      a rear corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is just the kind of place I like. By Jove, this
      building must be well over a hundred years old. Look at those beams in the
      ceiling. All they need is a few sporting prints and an open fireplace. Lit
      by candles, too, you see. Well, well, this is the real alehouse
      atmosphere. Why, it's as good as the Cheshire Cheese. This is the kind of
      place where I can imagine Doctor Johnson and Charles Lamb sitting in a
      corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an incurable sentimentalist,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Besides, Lamb would have
      had to sit on Johnson's knee, I expect. If I remember rightly, Lamb was a
      very small urchin when Doctor Johnson died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why be so literal?&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Haven't you any sentiment for fine
      antique flavour, and all that sort of thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is one thing where sentiment plays no part with me,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;it is food. At meal times I am distinctly a realist. Fine antique flavour
      is rather upsetting when you find it in your meat. But still,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;I must admit this looks good.&rdquo; He beamed approvingly at the
      thick chop and baked potatoes and beans and coffee the waiter had put down
      in front of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently you don't order your food,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They give you the
      standardized meal of the day. Fall to! These beans baked in cheese strike
      me as excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have never seen waiters rush around with such speed as they did in that
      crowded cellar, where flickering candle-gleams cast a tawny light over the
      crowded tables of men packed shoulder to shoulder. They flashed in and out
      through the rear door like men possessed. They careered in with trays of
      steaming viands, crashed them down on the bare tables, and fled out again,
      napkins streaming behind them like pennants. Once they had delivered your
      food it seemed impossible to catch their gaze, for we tried to hail one to
      ask for ketchup. It was no use. He flew hither and yon with frantic and
      single-minded energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These waiters speed like dervishes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Evidently the no-tip rule
      does not lessen their zeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they get a share in the profits of the enterprise,&rdquo; said Dulcet,
      placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just behind us was a small barred window looking out on a street. It was
      at the ground level, and looking through the dusty pane I could see
      horses' hoofs going by, and the feet of pedestrians. Suddenly there was a
      great clang and crash outside, and I turned to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up?&rdquo; said Dulcet, who was cheerfully disposing of his chop as well
      as his neighbour's elbow would permit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to have spilled some beans,&rdquo; I said, peering through the dusky
      aperture. &ldquo;There's a truck delivering food or something at the back door.
      They've tipped over a can, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spilled some beans?&rdquo; he said, with his first sign of real interest. &ldquo;That
      sounds symbolic. Let me have a look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood up on the bench and gazed outward. Presently he sat down again
      and went on calmly with his meal. Some excellent cheese cake was brought
      us as dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alley behind us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose it communicates with Beekman
      Street, doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wondering. Ben, I apologize for my skepticism. The food here is
      jolly good. In fact, it's so good that I think I've tasted it before. I am
      your debtor for a very enlarging experience. And now, as the crowd is
      becoming almost oppressive, and I can see that there are others eager to
      commute, suppose we smoke our cigars outdoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And since the food is eatable, and I happen to
      have the money with me, I think I'll invest in one of those strip tickets.
      Everyone else seems to be doing it, and it looks to me a good way to save
      money. A hundred lunches&mdash;why, that will see me through till spring.
      I don't think I'll get tired of eating here, it's so amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dove, as he picked up his hat, &ldquo;I don't think you'll get tired
      of eating here. Perhaps the money will be well spent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bought my commutation, and we stood in the shabby old courtyard for a
      few minutes watching the crowd stream in. A good many, I noticed, though
      unable to find seats, still took advantage of the opening-day offer and
      bought the hundred meal tickets for future consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only drawback about this place is the crowd,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If this keeps
      up, half of downtown New York will be eating here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Dove, &ldquo;I think I shall be down this way again to-morrow.
      It's my turn to buy. Will you lunch with me then? We'll celebrate the
      jovial Yule together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Meet you at the old red newspaper-box at the corner of
      Broadway and Vesey to-morrow at 12 o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We were both there punctually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got your appetite with you?&rdquo; asked Dove. &ldquo;It's a bit early for
      feasting, but it'll give us time for a stroll after lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do we eat?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Commutation again? It's all velvet to me,
      anyway, all my lunches are paid for for the next three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a little place on Beekman Street I used to know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let's
      try that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We found a corner table in an odd old eating house at the corner of
      Beekman and Gold streets, which I had never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a great believer in tit for tat, fair play, and all that sort of
      thing,&rdquo; said Dulcet when the waiter approached. &ldquo;You gave me an excellent
      lunch yesterday. I intend to give you the same lunch to-day, if you can
      stand eating it again. Waiter! Mutton chop, baked potato, baked beans,
      coffee, and cheese cake. For two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the beans came, baked with cheese in a little brown dish, just as
      they were served the day before, I must confess that I was startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, these beans are done exactly like those we had at the Commutation,&rdquo;
       I said. &ldquo;Are these people doing the cooking for the chop-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you'll have to eat chop and beans for a hundred lunches,&rdquo; Dulcet
      said. &ldquo;Well, it's a hearty diet. After all, the sandwich boards simply
      said a hundred meals. They didn't guarantee that they would be different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I insisted that on our way back toward the office we should stop at the
      Commutation Chophouse and find out from a customer what the bill of fare
      had been on the second day. The vision of a hundred repetitions of any
      meal, however good, is rather ghastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't hear the minstrel to-day,&rdquo; Dove observed as we drew near the
      alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that was just to draw business for the opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We turned down the passage at No. 59. Quite a crowd of patrons were
      waiting their turn, I saw. They were standing in the courtyard by the
      chop-house door, talking busily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it's still crowded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We reached the entrance. The door was closed. The sign over the doorway
      now had additional lettering painted on it, and read:
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE COMMUTATION CHOPHOUSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Other 99 Meals Will Be Served In Augusta, Maine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Ben,&rdquo; said Dulcet. &ldquo;No use trying to break through a window.
      There's no one there. I wonder what the fare is to Augusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rascal!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;If you suspected this, why the devil did you
      encourage me to squander my $10?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply said it would probably be well spent,&rdquo; he said, with a clear
      blue humorous gaze. &ldquo;If it helps to cauterize your magnificent credulity,
      it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat down on a bench in St. Paul's churchyard to smoke a pipe together
      while I performed some mental obsequies over my vanished Federal Reserve
      certificate. Dove looked up at the sparkling gilded turret of the
      Woolworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay Frank Woolworth would have fallen for it, too,&rdquo; Dove said. &ldquo;The
      idea of a hundred meals for 10 cents each would have appealed to him. But
      you know, old man, there are certain fixed and immutable laws that the
      observant city dweller is accustomed to. My motto is, whenever you find an
      apparent exception to those laws, look for an enigma in the woodpile. I
      suspected something wrong when I saw that sandwich man on Church Street. A
      man as fat as that doesn't generally take a job sandwiching. Also I have
      doubts about people who insist on calling Christmas 'Yule'. Moreover, a
      man doesn't generally take a job sandwiching until his shirt is so ragged
      that he is ashamed to exhibit it in public, when he is glad to cover it up
      with the boards. Those two fat sandwicheers were members of the firm, I
      fear, for their linen was O. K. And, secondly, what are the first things a
      man gets if he really intends to start a restaurant? A cash register and a
      bunch of ketchup bottles. There wasn't a cash register nor a ketchup
      bottle in sight in the Commutation Chophouse. No, my dear; what you
      admired as carefully arranged atmosphere of antiquity, the plain board
      tables and candles and so on, was really stark cheapness. They weren't
      spending any money on overhead; they said so themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you called my attention to the spilled beans, I was sure. For they
      were not merely beans: they were baked beans; a far more significant
      matter. When I looked out of the window I could see at once that there was
      no kitchen attached to the Commutation Chophouse. The food was all being
      delivered from that place on Beekman Street, whose name was on the truck.
      A few ingenious rogues simply rented that old cellar, cheaply enough I
      guess, put in a few tables, arranged to have grub shipped in from near by,
      printed their commutation tickets, and sat down to collect as many dollars
      as they could lure out of the open-handed Christmas throng.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all infernal liars,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;they certainly take the prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Dulcet as we got up to go. &ldquo;You should have read the
      sandwich boards a little more carefully. Their ingenious author, whom you
      chide as the Ann Street Ananias, really told the exact and circumstantial
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood at the gateway of the graveyard, and gazed across the roaring
      traffic of Broadway. Dove smiled and said he must be starting on his
      Christmas shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to warn you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you wouldn't listen. As I was about
      to say just before we visited the place, it was queer that it should
      happen on Ann Street. Don't you remember that a certain famous gentleman
      had his museum at the corner of Broadway and Ann? And it was he, I think,
      who remarked that there's one born every minute. Well, Merry Christmas!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE PERT LITTLE HAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>EMMING had a home,
      and dearly he loved everything in it&mdash;with one exception. He loved
      the furnace, and the kitchen range with its warm ruddy glow, and the
      violet-coloured wafer of expensive aromatic soap that always mysteriously
      appeared on the marble wash-basin when visitors came. He loved the little
      glass towel racks, and the miniature embroidered hand towels with Mrs.
      Hemming's maiden initials on them, which also appeared, white and
      fragrant, whenever there was any special festivity. Those little towels
      were to him a kind of symbol of the first ecstatic days of their married
      life, and he could not bear to think of the inevitable time when they
      would be frayed and discarded. He loved the shelf over the fireplace where
      his brown-stained corncob pipe waited for the after-supper smoke. He loved
      the little porch where the baby carriage stood, and the tulip beds that he
      and Janet had planted together, and the mission dining table, now
      blistered and scarred, that had been their very first piece of furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the little den upstairs stood his desk, and how he hated it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hemming, you see, had literary ambitions, and that desk meant to him every
      circumstance, every long-drawn torment, of weariness and toil. It had
      meant much pleasure, too, in hours when his writing had prospered; but how
      the bitter outnumbered the sweet! How many hundred evenings he had dragged
      himself to it, in lassitude and lethargy; had forced his drowsy, unwilling
      mind to the task at hand. How many nights, nodding over the typewriter, he
      had stumbled on and on. Over his desk he kept, ironically, a letter he had
      once had from an editor, which said: <i>We like stories. They have a
      joyous freshness. You write as though you enjoyed it.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hemming was no quick and easy composer. His stories emerged slowly,
      painfully, hammered and wrenched from the stubborn tissues of a weary
      brain. When his whole soul and body cried out for a comfortable stretch on
      the couch, with pipe and book, and a gradual, blissful lapse into slumber,
      he would throw off his coat, stick his head out of the window for a dozen
      gulps of cool night air, and then sit down at the wheezy old typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its yellow keys seemed a kind of doleful rosary on which he told long
      petitions to whatever gods look down pityingly on young writers. He would
      think how wonderful it would be if he could only do his writing in the
      morning when he was fresh. To leap out of bed in the crisp early air, to
      plunge into the cold bath where the water shimmered a pale green by
      catching the tint of the big maple tree just outside the bathroom, to
      swallow two cups of hot coffee, two slices of buttered toast, and then sit
      down to his desk. In the zest and lustihood of the morning, how the
      thoughts would throng, how the great empire of words would unroll before
      him, far away to the blue hills where lived his unwritten poems! Such was
      his daily thought as he hurried down the hill on bright mornings to catch
      the 8.13 train to town. But to come back at night after a long day at the
      office, and after helping Janet wash the dishes, and stoking the furnace
      or mowing the lawn or planting bulbs in the garden&mdash;then to try to
      write seemed tough indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, it had to be done, and Hemming threw his manhood into the task. In
      his little den there was just space for a couch, his desk, and his books,
      which were littered about the room. His only chance of accomplishing
      anything was to get Janet safely installed on the couch, for if he once
      lay down there work was impossible. She would curl up under a steamer rug,
      tired out from a long day with the house and the baby, reading a book or
      the evening paper. And then the stumbling clatter of the typewriter would
      begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while there always came what they humorously called &ldquo;the pathetic
      little moment.&rdquo; This was the time when Janet's book or paper would slip
      from her hand, she would turn away from the light, and coast down the
      long, smooth toboggan of sleep. Then Hemming would switch off the reading
      lamp above her head (with the secret economic satisfaction young
      householders always feel when they switch off a light), touch the soft
      cheek with a friendly finger, and climb the keys once more. His writing
      always seemed to go better after the &ldquo;pathetic little moment&rdquo; was past.
      There was a kind of subconscious satisfaction in the feeling that Janet
      was there, asleep, and that he was working for her. And Janet used to
      affirm that there was no lullaby like the irregular thumping of those keys
      and levers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another catchword they had, which also moved stealthily in the
      back passages of his mind as he mulled over his manuscripts. Janet badly
      needed a new bonnet&mdash;a &ldquo;pert little hat,&rdquo; she liked to call it&mdash;and
      Hemming had pledged himself to write something that would bring her the
      saucy little ornament she craved in time for Christmas. She was a slender,
      bright-faced creature, and no one could wear an innocently tilted turban
      with more grace. But these had been hard days for small incomes. Winter
      coal, and warm clothes for the Urchin, and the cook's wages (when they had
      one), and Liberty Bonds&mdash;all these had taken precedence over the pert
      little hat. It had been talked of so long, it had become a kind of joyous
      legend, which Janet hardly expected to see realized on her head. She used
      to say wistfully, as she coasted off to sleep on the couch: &ldquo;Would it be
      unpatriotic to think about the pert little hat?&rdquo; And her husband would vow
      that patriotism that excluded pert little hats was no patriotism at all.
      So he had sworn that the bonnet should be millinered on the clacking loom
      of his typewriter. They used to laugh about it, and say that the little
      hat ought to be trimmed with carbon typewriter ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hemming did not know that Janet was not always asleep after the
      so-called &ldquo;pathetic moment&rdquo; when she ostensibly gave up the struggle with
      drowsiness. The twanging springs of the old couch made less noise than the
      typewriter keys, but they, too, moved to a secret creative refrain. There
      were times when Janet lay watching the lamplight on the rows of books, and
      little pictures of stories that she would like to write flashed into her
      head. They often used to come to her at inopportune periods during the
      day, when the Urchin was in his bath or when she was taking stock of the
      ice-box. Of course her husband was the literary man of the family, and she
      had no thought of setting up her simple imaginings against his more
      serious efforts. But one night, when he was engrossed in some intractable
      plot, Janet slipped away into the little guest room and shut herself in.
      With a stub pencil, on odd sheets of notepaper, she began scribbling
      hotly. Two hours later, when Hemming came back to earth and hunted her
      out, she was still at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you up to, monk?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making out laundry lists,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      More observant husbands might have wondered what occasion there would be
      for a laundry list on Thursday evening, but Hemming was always drowned in
      his dreams of literary fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      His story, on which he had laboured at night for two months, and hers,
      which had taken the spare hours of three days, were finished almost at the
      same time. After dinner one night, when he had read the manuscript of his
      story aloud, Janet handed him her venture, with some trepidation. At first
      he seemed a little nettled that she should have done such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, monk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you oughtn't to wear yourself out trying to
      write. You have quite enough to do with the house and the baby. Moreover,
      you don't know how discouraging it is. It takes years of patient
      apprenticeship before one can get anything across with the editors. This
      is my job, brownie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I enjoyed doing it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a bad sign. All really good stories take fearful effort. How long
      did you spend on this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite a while,&rdquo; she said, vaguely. She did not like to admit that her
      little story had involved no &ldquo;patient apprenticeship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit his pipe and began reading the sheets on which her quick pencil had
      flashed with such enthusiasm. She sat with her sewing, watching him shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; was his comment; but privately he wondered how he was to
      avoid hurting her feelings. It seemed to him that the story had all the
      faults of the amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you submit it anywhere?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly. &ldquo;Do you think any
      magazine would buy it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He evaded the question. &ldquo;Would you like me to type it for you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>would</i> you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what I'll do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll be sending my manuscript to
      Mr. Edwards to-morrow. I'll type yours and send it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet was delighted, and she fell asleep that night with the sweet music
      of the thumping keys in her ears. As she heard the staccato clicking, she
      thought: &ldquo;I wonder how far he has got now? How good of him to take all
      that trouble to copy my poor little story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hemming sat up very late that night, copying Janet's manuscript and
      planning what to say to Mr. Edwards, the editor of the <i>Colonial
      Magazine</i>, who had been very cordial to him. He resisted the temptation
      to alter Janet's naïve phrasing here and there, to improve her technique
      by recasting some of the situations in her story. It was long past
      midnight when both manuscripts were ready to go into the stout manila
      envelope. Then, after some meditation, Hemming added the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Mr. Edwards:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I am sending you herewith my new story, and hope you may like it. I am
      also enclosing a manuscript from my wife. Of course she is an untrained
      writer&mdash;this is her first attempt&mdash;but I think her story has a
      certain charm. Won't you, if you can, give her any encouragement you feel
      proper? If you would write her a personal note of comment it would mean a
      great deal to her. You know how tenderly one feels toward one's maiden
      effort.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sincerely yours,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Godfrey Hemming.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very late when Hemming folded the carefully typed sheets and placed
      them in the precious envelope. He was utterly weary, which must be the
      explanation of a curious error he made. It was his custom to type his name
      and address on a separate sheet of paper which was clipped to the story he
      was submitting. He put his own name on one sheet, and his wife's on
      another. But in arranging the manuscripts for the envelope he
      inadvertently put his name-page with his wife's manuscript, and vice
      versa. Then he went to bed with the satisfaction of well-earned fatigue,
      and wondering how soon he would be able to order the &ldquo;pert little hat&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two weeks later, and the Urchin had just murmured himself off into
      his morning nap, when Janet heard the postman's whistle, and ran down to
      receive an envelope with the name of the <i>Colonial Magazine</i> engraved
      upon it. Eagerly she tore it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Mrs. Hemming:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your husband was good enough to send me the manuscript of your story,
      which I have read with interest. It is an able piece of work, and shows
      unusual technical skill for a beginner. But I must caution you not to let
      your pen follow the track of your husband's method too closely. Naturally
      enough, perhaps, your style seems to have modeled itself on his: but this
      is a mistake, because it is quite evident that you have ability enough to
      strike out on your own line. I wish you would study carefully Mr.
      Hemming's last story, &ldquo;Three Is Company,&rdquo; which shows a freshness and
      spontaneous originality better than anything he has done before. It has a
      touch of charming humour which is new to his work. If you can do us
      something of that sort, we shall be only too happy to publish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am returning your manuscript with many thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faithfully yours
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore Edwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet looked at the editor's flowing signature in amazement. &ldquo;Three Is
      Company&rdquo; was her own story. And there, in the <i>Colonial Magazine's</i>
      envelope, lay the revered pages of Godfrey's masterpiece, returned. The
      &ldquo;fresh and spontaneous originality&rdquo; was hers! A flush of exultation
      thrilled her: she could almost feel the pert little hat on her head.
      Instinctively she looked at herself in the mirror over the hall
      mantelpiece. Was it possible that she was a literary genius, and had never
      known it?
    </p>
    <p>
      But then a pang of horror chilled her. What dreadful mistake had happened?
      Alas, it was only too plain&mdash;the two stories had been confused. The
      editor had thought that her story was Godfrey's. He had read it expecting
      to find the skill of Godfrey's trained hand. And now how was she to spare
      her husband the mortification of having his painstaking work rejected,
      while her prentice sketch had won favour by some fluke? Her loyal heart,
      entirely devoid of selfish satisfaction, could not bear the thought of
      this grotesque and unhappy climax for her innocent venture. It was all her
      fault for meddling with what did not concern her. What business had she to
      write a better story than Godfrey, anyway? She knew that her husband would
      be honestly proud of her success and would not grudge her the triumph for
      an instant, but she felt that the poignance of the situation would be
      intolerable for her. Much better do without all the pert little hats on
      Chestnut Street than win one at the expense of Godfrey's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could she prevent the bad tidings from reaching him? Even now it might
      be too late. She flew to the telephone, and with pricking pulses asked for
      the office of the <i>Colonial</i>. One nervous hand unconsciously flew to
      her hair, as though she were about to enter the august sanctum of the
      editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Mr. Edwards?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Edwards, this is Mrs. Hemming, Mrs. Godfrey Hemming, the wife of
      one of your authors&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there's been a terrible mistake about our manuscripts, Mr. Edwards,
      the stories that Mr. Hemming sent you. I've just had your letter, and that
      story you sent back wasn't mine at all, it was Godfrey's&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you can have made the mistake&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the story called 'Three Is Company' is mine, I wrote it, but really
      it can't possibly be better than the other one because I wrote it in such
      a hurry, it's my first attempt&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to publish it? But, Mr. Edwards, you simply mustn't, because&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't explain over the telephone. I know you only like it because you
      thought&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise not to do anything about it, and not to tell Mr. Hemming
      anything, until you get a letter from me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i> promise? Oh, thank you so much! I'll write at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried to the little white enamelled desk, the same desk where the
      ill-starred &ldquo;Three Is Company&rdquo; had been written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will cure me of trying to write,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;why, I never heard
      of such a thing&mdash;to have one's first story accepted! Mr. Edwards must
      be mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luckily there was one sheet of her engraved stationery left&mdash;the
      paper that Godfrey had given her, she thought remorsefully. All about her
      were evidences of his loving care, and she had repaid him by undermining
      his prestige with the one editor who had been nice to him. A fine way for
      an author's wife to behave! She seized her pen and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Edwards:
    </p>
    <p>
      As I just told you over the phone, there has been some horrible mistake.
      How it happened I can't guess. The manuscript you sent back to me is Mr.
      Hemming's story. The one you say you like and want me to study as a model
      is my own story, &ldquo;Three Is Company&rdquo;. I'm sorry you like it, I mean I'm
      sorry you think it is better than Mr. Hemming's story, which can't be so
      as it is the first story I ever tried to write. I have decided to withdraw
      it, I don't want it published, so please send it back to me instantly, and
      write me a letter saying how amateurish it is. I am sending Mr. Hemming's
      story back to you, so that now you know who wrote it you can reconsider
      it. Of course, if you thought it was by me, you naturally considered it as
      the work of a beginner, and only a poor imitation of Mr. Hemming's style.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't want you ever to tell Mr. Hemming that I have written this letter.
      Just tell him you sent my story back to me because it was not good enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet Colton Hemming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance Janet attached to this letter may be judged from the fact
      that she left the baby alone in the house, asleep, while she hurried down
      to the post-office to mail it, together with Godfrey's manuscript, back to
      Mr. Edwards. And not even the sympathetic Mr. Edwards ever guessed that on
      the first page, where Godfrey's careful typing ran in neat lines, she had
      printed a good luck kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor was an honourable man, and though he chuckled a little over
      Janet's breathless letter he really meant to keep the innocent secret. We
      hope that no young wives will be lured to destruction by our telling the
      truth, which was simply this, that Janet's little story was much better
      than Godfrey's. It might not have happened again in a lifetime, but the
      enthusiasm of her girlish zeal had carried her pen into a very pretty and
      moving tale, which the <i>Colonial</i> would have been glad to print. But
      since she wanted it back, there was nothing for Mr. Edwards to do but
      comply. Then, that very morning, while he was dictating a note of polite
      refusal to accompany &ldquo;Three Is Company&rdquo; back to the suburbs, who should
      call at the office but Godfrey, to know what the editor thought of the two
      stories. The coincidence was too much for Edwards, and thinking that it
      could do no harm to let Hemming know of his wife's devotion&mdash;for
      young husbands are too likely to be selfish&mdash;he told him the whole
      incident. And Godfrey, with a faint sensation of burning under his
      eyelids, related the dream of a new bonnet that had inspired &ldquo;Three Is
      Company&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, look here,&rdquo; said Edwards, &ldquo;I'm not so awfully keen on this
      story of yours. It isn't anywhere near up to what you can do&mdash;or
      rather, up to what Mrs. Hemming can do,&rdquo; he added, chuckling. &ldquo;But you go
      home and write me a yarn about the pert little hat, and I'll put it in the
      January number. It'll come out just before Christmas, and I hope you'll
      get that wife of yours the best bonnet in town on the proceeds. If all
      writers had wives like yours, perhaps the magazines would make better
      reading. But for heaven's sake don't tell Mrs. Hemming I gave her away.
      Wait until she sees the story in the magazine, it'll be a Christmas
      surprise for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the Saturday before Christmas Hemming took Janet to the city to
      solemnize the purchase of the pert little hat. Any one who happened to see
      her wearing it down Chestnut Street that bright winter afternoon knew that
      the elated pink in her cheek was not all reflected from the red bow on the
      bonnet's neat brim. As they sat down for a matinée and Janet removed the
      precious creation, giving it to Godfrey to hold for a moment, he said
      admiringly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the old typing bus isn't such a bad milliner after all, hey, monk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Janet, who would then have denied that such a story as &ldquo;Three Is
      Company&rdquo; ever existed, replied innocently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so glad Mr. Edwards turned down my story, grump. I like the pert
      little hat ever so much better because it came all from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even if the pert little hat should live to be a great-great-grandbonnet,
      none of its descendants will ever give Janet such pleasure.

      breakfast is the first maxim for commuters and their wives. Partings in
      anger mean day-long misery for both, and generally involve telephone calls
      later in the day, and a box of chocolate-coated maraschino cherries
      carried home on the 5.18. Marriage (say the philosophers) is a subdivision
      of the penal code, dedicated to the proposition that men and women are
      created equal. But the studious observer of matrimonial feints and
      skirmishes sees very little to verify that daring surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Bennett sipped his breakfast coffee grimly. Its savour had departed:
      for ninety seconds earlier Mrs. Bennett had fled upstairs in a flush of
      anger and tears. In five minutes he would have to run for the train; and
      what man can soothe an outraged wife in five minutes? He ate his toast
      without relish, gazing sourly on the blue-and-white imitation Copenhagen
      china, the pretty little porcelain marmalade pot, and the big silver
      coffee-urn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desperate inequality of married life pierced his heart. Why should he
      have to accept in silence tart remarks uttered by his wife, while the
      least savagery of his own was cause for tears?
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed upstairs to say a few consoling words. The bedroom door was
      locked. Compassion fled, and he growled furiously through the panels. Then
      he ran hotly for the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems unreasonable: but the lives of human beings are not guided by
      reason. Harry had come to the conclusion that the silver coffee-urn was at
      the bottom of all their squabbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Elaine Addison surrendered herself into his capable hands, there
      had been a competitor for the honour of surrounding her with sectional
      bookcases, linen closets, potted hydrangeas, and the other authentic
      trappings of a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubrey Andrews was the rival warrior. He was the kind of man who always
      has a lot of crisp greenbacks in a neat leather bill-fold. Harry's
      hard-earned frogskins were always crumpled in a trousers pocket This may
      seem trivial, but it distinguishes two totally different classes of men.
      Aubrey was tall, dark, well groomed; he played billiards and belonged to
      expensive clubs. It was supposed that his wife would be beyond the reach
      of financial worries. He kept a horse and easy office hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry&mdash;well, Harry was no aristocrat. He worked hard for what he got,
      and didn't get much. He was neither tall, nor dark, nor well groomed. But
      he was a fine, lovable, high-minded chap, and to everyone's surprise,
      including his own, he got Elaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson had a good deal to do with it, I think. Harry still read
      Tennyson, although that excellent poet is no longer fashionable, and kept
      on repeating what Tennyson said about Elaine. And finally Elaine could not
      help saying, &ldquo;My Lancelot!&rdquo; and melting into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubrey gave them a magnificent silver coffee-urn for a wedding present,
      and presently enlisted for service, first on the Mexican border and then
      in France, where he became a heroic and legendary figure, surrounded in
      Elaine's mind by the prismatic glamour of girlhood days.
    </p>
    <p>
      That coffee-urn was a stunner! It was far the handsomest thing in the
      little suburban house, except, of course, Elaine herself. Beneath its
      shining caldron sat an alcohol lamp that rendered a blue flame and kept
      the coffee hot. Elaine's initials&mdash;her maiden initials&mdash;were
      engraved upon it, and those of the donor: E. A. A. A. The hand of the
      insidious silversmith had twined the A's together very gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time he looked at it, Harry felt subconsciously irritated, although
      he hardly realized why.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood on the little mission sideboard, outshining everything else in
      the pretty dining room. It was Elaine's particular pride, and was used
      only on special occasions. Often it was brought out for the little
      celebrations that young married couples have every now and then. And,
      curiously enough, these celebrations very often ended in tears. The
      polished dazzle of those silver curves was only too apt to suggest to
      Elaine's radiant little beauty-loving heart other handsome wares she would
      like to have, or unlucky comparison of the relative beauty of the wedding
      presents sent by <i>her</i> friends and <i>his;</i> or Harry would make
      some blunt remark about his not being able to give her all that some other
      husband might have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! Something of the sardonic spirit of the black-browed Aubrey seemed
      to radiate from his urn. Can a coffee-um hypnotize? Grotesque as it
      appears, little by little they realized that the innocent piece of silver
      was marring many an otherwise happy hour.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way to town in the smoking car, Harry's mind rotated savagely
      about their absurd tiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see, how was it? He had said: &ldquo;I'm sorry, dearest; I shall have to
      be rather late tonight. The head of my department is away, and I've got an
      extra lot of work to do.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear! Then we
      sha'n't be able to go to the theatre, shall we?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;We can go next
      week, Brownie.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Something horrid always happens when we have
      this coffee-urn on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (N. B. Right here, when the danger topic was introduced, he should have
      put on an extra soft pedal. But did he? Not a bit. As soon as the urn was
      mentioned his eyes began to flash.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't let's have it on so often!&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Any one
      might think you were jealous of it. It's the only handsome piece of silver
      I've got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he did make one honest effort to steer away from danger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry about to-night, honey, but the work's just got to be
      done.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Why didn't you let me know sooner you were going to work
      late? I could have arranged to go and see Mother.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Oh, well,
      everything I do is always wrong, anyway! I suppose if I could buy you a
      roomful of silver like that old tureen, you wouldn't mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after that it was not far to the deluge. All conducted according to
      the recognized technique of quarrelling, passing through the seven stages
      of repartee outlined by Touchstone, which should never be forgotten by
      those happily married:

      All day both Mr. and Mrs. Bennett were unpleasantly conscious of their
      undigested altercation lying black and gloomy in the back of their minds.
      At lunch-time he tried to call her on the telephone; but the wire did not
      answer. Indeed, she had gone to spend the day in town with friends, and
      was to go to dinner and the theatre with them. She left no message for
      Harry, and gave the cook permission to go out overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      About nine o'clock he got home tired and eager to resume their usual
      blissful companionship. The house was dark and untenanted. In a rage, he
      threw away the box of candy he had brought, and got himself some bread and
      cheese from the ice-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining room his eye fell upon the coffee-urn. He swore at it. Just
      then Elaine called him up, and in a cool, distant voice told him that she
      had decided to spend the night in town with her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Elaine came home about ten o'clock, humming a merry
      little air as she walked down the quiet suburban street. She and Harry had
      patched things up over the telephone at breakfast-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was shining brightly, and she was planning a specially nice dinner
      for poor Harry that evening. After all, it wasn't the dear boy's fault
      that he had to work so hard. It was horrible of her to run off and desert
      him that way. Tonight she would show him how much she loved him. They
      would have ice cream with hot chocolate sauce, and meringues and chicken
      salad; and she would buy him a cigar and hide it in his napkin. And the
      old coffee-um should go back in the glass cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook, with a very grave face, opened the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, Emily, what's the matter?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bennett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burgled!&rdquo; said Emily, tragically. &ldquo;Someone's been an' bruk in the
      dining-room winder. Footpads, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennett gave a little shriek of dismay She ran to the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      One window stood an inch or two open, and one of the panes was broken. She
      glanced round the room. Nothing was disarranged, but her glance fell on
      the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coffee-urn was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that's very extraordinary. Mr. Bennett slept here last
      night, and he's a light sleeper. He always locks the windows before he
      goes to bed. Is anything else missing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The apple pie's gone out o' the ice-box,&rdquo; said Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, that's Mr. Bennett, I'm sure,&rdquo; said Elaine. &ldquo;I'll call up the
      police right away, and see if they can do anything. My nice coffee-urn!
      Why, it's the finest thing we had in the whole house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the police arrived, Mrs. Bennett herself took a careful look round
      the outside of the house. She found nothing unusual except a cigar butt
      lying on the ground near the broken window. She picked it up gingerly. A
      section of the gilt band still adhered to the wrapper. She could read the
      name, <i>Florona.</i> She carried the fragment into the cellar and threw
      it into the ash-can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two policemen arrived shortly, examined everything, and asked innumerable
      questions. Mrs. Bennett gave them a careful description of the coffee-urn.
      They departed, promising to do everything possible to trace it. They said
      that a piece of silver so large and unusual would not be hard to locate
      with the aid of the pawnbrokers. Then Mrs. Bennett went upstairs to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed very strange that the thieves should take the urn and nothing
      else, when there were other pieces of silver beside it on the sideboard.
      She called up Harry, who was horrified to learn of the loss. He had slept
      right through the night without hearing a sound. He offered to come home
      if he could do anything to help; but she would not hear of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Mrs. Bennett had a special little dinner waiting for her
      husband: his favourite soup, a tender steak, fried potatoes, ice cream
      with hot chocolate sauce. And after dinner they discussed the theft of the
      urn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand how it was that you didn't hear anything,&rdquo; said
      Elaine. &ldquo;You generally sleep so lightly. Did you sit up late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I sat in the dining room until about ten, eating cheese
      and apple pie, and smoking a cigar. Then I went to bed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you just reminded me!&rdquo; cried Elaine. &ldquo;I bought you a nice cigar to
      smoke after your dinner, and I forgot to give it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the mantelpiece she gave him a cigar with a <i>Florona</i> band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, isn't that nice!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;That's the kind I always smoke. I didn't
      think you knew one brand from the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know more than you think, old man,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Harry came home the next night, he brought a bulky parcel with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry about the urn, Brownie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I went to see the
      detectives to-day, and they think there's very little chance of getting it
      back; so I brought you this to take its place.&rdquo; She opened the package. It
      was a big China coffee-jug of rose-and-white porcelain, flagrantly out of
      harmony with her silver and blue china.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think it's just lovely. It's ever and ever so much
      nicer than that old urn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week later, in the afternoon, the local chief of police called up Mrs.
      Bennett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down here to the police station,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We've found your
      coffee-pot. The most extraordinary thing you ever heard of. We found it
      buried in a haystack, back of Webster's barn. Why any one should leave it
      there is more than I know. The thief must have been frightened and hid it.
      Will you come down and identify it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennett hastened down to the police station. There on the sergeant's
      table stood the famous urn, the pride of her heart. There was no doubt
      about it: the initials were there&mdash;it was hers. Tarnished and spotted
      by exposure, it was still the handsomest piece of silver she had ever
      seen. Involuntarily she gave a cry of delight. Then she hesitated. After
      all, compared to Harry's happiness and hers, what was a silver urn?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, captain,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm so disappointed. That's not mine! It's very
      much like it, but it isn't mine.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE BATTLE OF MANILA ENVELOPES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. BIRDLIP was a
      good old man, of unimpeachable simplicity. He had achieved enormous wealth
      in an honourable business, and then found (to his mild distress) that the
      great traffic he had built up conducted itself automatically. He had, in a
      way, been gently shouldered out of his own nest by the capable men whose
      fortunes he had made. But his zealous and frugal spirit required some sort
      of problem to feed upon, and he delighted his heart by owning a newspaper.
      <i>The Evening Lens</i> was his toy and the child of his dotage.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Persian rugs and walnut panelling of his private suite in the huge
      Birdlip Building saw him rarely. He was supremely happy in the dingy
      sanctum at the back of the old <i>Lens</i> office, where the hum of the
      presses and the racket of the city room (which he still, by an innocent
      misunderstanding, called the &ldquo;sitting room&rdquo;) delighted his guileless
      heart. He would sit turning over the pages of each edition as it came
      upstairs (putting his second finger up to his tongue before he turned each
      leaf) and poring industriously over the market reports, the comics, and
      the Woman's Page. With his pink cheeks, his dapper little figure in a
      brown suit and cream-coloured waistcoat, and his eager, shy, chirping
      manner, he was very like a robin. Although he was full of gigantic
      schemes, which he broached naively in the editorial council every now and
      then, he never wittingly interfered with his editor-in-chief, in whom he
      had full confidence. But his gentle and jejune mind had a disastrous
      effect on the paper no less. Almost unconsciously the Lens was written and
      edited down to his standard, as a roomful of adults will amiably prattle
      so as to carry along a child in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Birdlip's amazing success in his original field had been due partly to
      his decent sagacity, honesty, and persistence, and partly to his sheer
      fortune in finding (at the very outset of his enterprise) several men of
      rugged ability, who became the pearls in his simple oyster-shell. As a
      result of this, it had become his fixed mental habit to believe that
      somewhere, some day, he would encounter the man or men who would make the
      <i>Lens</i> the greatest newspaper in the country. This, indeed, was his
      candid ambition, and he never went anywhere without keeping his eyes open
      for the anticipated messiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was greatly taken by broad primitive effects: when he noticed that a
      Chicago daily always called itself &ldquo;The World's Greatest Newspaper&rdquo; he was
      marvellously struck by the power of this slogan, and lamented that he had
      not thought of it first. The question as to whether the slogan were true
      or not never occurred to him. He liked to have the keynote sentences in
      the leading editorial emphasized in blackface type, so that there might be
      no danger of any one's missing the point. Desiring for his beloved sheet
      &ldquo;this man's art and that man's scope,&rdquo; as the sonnet puts it, every now
      and then he thought he had discovered the prodigy, and some new feature
      would be added to the paper at outrageous expense, only to be quietly
      shovelled out six months or a year later. In the meantime, the auditor was
      growing very gray, and even Mr. Birdlip's quick blue eye was sometimes
      hazed with faint perplexity when he studied the circulation charts.
      Perhaps it would have been kinder if someone could have told him that a
      boyhood spent in splitting infinitives is not sufficient training for one
      to become an Abraham Lincoln of the newspaper business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he trotted in and out of the <i>Lens</i> office, with his rosy air of
      confidence and his disarming simplicity (which made his white hair seem a
      wanton cruelty on the part of Time, that would wither a man's cells while
      his mind was still on all fours), Mr. Birdlip was the object of furtive
      but very sharp study on the part of some cynical journalists whom he
      hired. It was a genuine amazement to Sanford, the dramatic critic, that
      the owner was so entirely unaware of his (Sanford's) abilities, which
      certainly (he thought) called for a salary of more than sixty dollars a
      week. Sanford often meditated about this, and not entirely in secret. In
      fact, it was generally admitted among the younger members of the staff,
      when they gathered at Ventriloquo's for lunch, that the Old Man was
      immaculately ignorant of all phases of the newspaper business. While the
      spaghetti and mushrooms cheered the embittered gossips, merry and quaint
      were the quips sped toward the unsuspecting target. Sanford's private
      grievance was that though for over a year he had been doing signed
      critiques of plays, which were really spirited and honest, not once had
      the Old Man condescended to mention them, or to show any sign of uttering
      an <i>Ecce Homo</i> in his direction. As far as he was concerned, he felt
      that the weekly battle of Manila Envelopes was a conspicuous rout, and he
      frequently rehearsed the exact tone in which he would some day say to the
      managing editor: &ldquo;You may fire when ready, Gridley.&rdquo; Little did Sanford
      realize that the only time Mr. Birdlip had attempted to read the &ldquo;Exits
      and Entrances&rdquo; column he had met the name of Æschylus, had faltered, and
      retreated upon the syndicated sermon by the Rev. Frank Crane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw 'Ruddigore' the other evening,&rdquo; said Sanford to his cronies, as
      they called for a second round of coffee. &ldquo;There's a line in it that
      describes old Birdie fore, aft, and amidships. Something like this: 'He is
      that particular variety of good old man to whom the truth is always a
      refreshing novelty'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They complauded. Rightly or wrongly, these high-spirited and sophisticated
      young men had decided that Mr. Birdlip's naïveté was so refreshingly
      complete that it gave them an aesthetic pleasure to contemplate it. It had
      the exquisite beauty of any absolute perfection. Their employer's latest
      venture, which had been to pay $200,000 for the exclusive right to publish
      and syndicate the mysterious formulae of a leading Memory Course, had
      shocked them very greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It touched them in a tender spot to know that there had been all that
      money lying round the office, unused, which was now to be squandered (as
      they put it) on charlatanry, when they felt that they might just as well
      have had some of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Old Man is always looking for some special stunt, and trying to
      discover someone on the outside,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;He can't see the material
      right under his nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's really rather pathetic: he's crazy to get out a great newspaper, but
      he hasn't the faintest idea how to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, give him credit for sincerity. It isn't just circulation he wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circulation's easy enough, if that's what you're after. The three
      builders of circulation are Sordid, Sensational, and Sex&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the greatest of these is Sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's decent enough. He won't pander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He panders to stupidity. He's fallen for this Memory bunk. And when he
      finds that's a flivver, he'll try something else, equally fatuous. He's
      making the old <i>Lens</i> ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They smoked awhile, meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I would like to figure out,&rdquo; said Sanford, &ldquo;is some way of making an
      impression on the Old Man. I've got to get more money. The trouble&mdash;some
      part of it is, I feel instinctively that he and I live in different
      worlds. We hardly even talk the same language. Well, there's no chance of
      his learning my way of thinking; so I suppose I'll have to learn his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the man who puts the nil in the Manila envelope,&rdquo; said one of the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as we are concerned, yes. But there's plenty of the stuff going
      round on Fridays for the kind of people he understands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be an absent-minded old bird. When I talk to him, it's as
      though I were trying to speak through a fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me as though his mind had overstayed its leave of absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He likes the kind of men who, as he says, 'have both feet on the
      ground'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you've got to have at least one foot in the air if you're going
      to get anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said the literary editor, who was more tolerant than the
      others. &ldquo;What's the use of panning the Old Man? He's trying to put the
      paper over, just as hard as we are. Maybe harder. But he doesn't know. And
      I believe he knows he doesn't know. I think the chief trouble is, they all
      knuckle down to him so. They're scared of him. They think the only way
      they can hold their jobs is by agreeing with him. If someone could only
      put him wise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how <i>can</i> you put him wise? He doesn't see anything unless it's
      laid out for him in a strip cartoon or a full-page ad. The kind of thing
      that interests him is the talk he hears in a Pullman smoker or club car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact. You know he always says he likes to go travelling, because
      he picks up ideas from people on the train. 'Of course I place you! Mr.
      Mowbray Monk of Seattle. And is your Rotary Club still rotating?' That
      kind of talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you're right,&rdquo; said Sanford. &ldquo;He doesn't see us because we have
      too much protective colouring. We are only the patient drudges. We don't
      talk that Pullman palaver about Big Business. We've got to learn to talk
      his language. What is that phrase of Bacon's&mdash;we've got to bring
      ourselves home to his business and bosom&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's get back to the office,&rdquo; said the disillusioned literary editor.
      &ldquo;That's the way to bring home the bacon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later Sanford was at his desk, clipping and pasting press
      agents' flimsies for the Saturday Theatre Page. This was a task which he
      hated above all others, and he was meditating sourly on the scarcity of
      truth in human affairs. At this moment Mr. Birdlip happened to pass along
      the corridor outside the editorial rooms. Sanford heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Flaccus, will you get me a seat in the club car, ten o'clock train
      to-morrow? I've got to run over to New York to take lunch with Mr.
      Montaigne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanford put down his shears, relit his pipe, and began to pursue a
      fugitive idea round the suburbs of his mind. Presently he drew out his
      check book from a drawer and did some calculating on a sheet of paper. &ldquo;A
      hundred dollars,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I guess it's worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, dressed in a new suit and with shoes freshly
      burnished, Sanford was at the terminal twenty minutes before train time.
      With him was a young man carrying a leather portfolio. To observe the
      respectful demeanour of this young man, no one would have suspected that
      he was Sanford's young brother-in-law, rejoicing in cutting his classes at
      college for a day's masquerading. Sanford bought some cigars (a form of
      smoking which he detested) and carefully removed the bands from all but
      one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mr. Birdlip appeared, cheerfully trotting up the stairs. Sanford
      and his companion followed discreetly. As Mr. Birdlip went through the
      gate, they were close behind. Entering the club car, Mr. Birdlip sat down
      and opened a morning paper. Sanford and his companion were prompt to take
      the two adjoining seats. Sanford began to look over <i>System</i> and <i>Printers'
      Ink</i>, and perhaps his interest in these vigorous journals was not
      wholly unfeigned, for it was the first time he had studied them. The young
      man beside him drew out a mass of papers from his leather bag, and in a
      moment of stillness just before the train started said in a clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, sir, but there is some important dictation here that ought to be
      attended to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanford assumed the air of a man wearied with tremendous affairs. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, what comes first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The New York <i>Budget</i> has wired for an answer in regard to their
      proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanford blew a luxurious whiff of smoke. &ldquo;Take this letter: My dear Mr.
      Ralston. Replying to your inquiries as to whether I would be willing to
      take charge of the editorial page of the <i>Budget</i> for a few months,
      to put the paper on its feet, I am willing to consider the matter, and
      would be pleased to discuss it with you if you will run over to see me. I
      am very busy just now, and could not possibly undertake the work for some
      weeks. I have been retained in an advisory capacity by a big Western
      syndicate which was badly in need of some circulation building; and until
      I can put their paper up to a half-million figure I have not much spare
      time. Their paper has gone up a couple of hundred thousand since I mapped
      out a campaign for them, but I would not feel justified in discontinuing
      my services to them until these gains are properly consolidated. I will be
      in my office at ten o'clock next Tuesday morning if you care to see me.
      Very truly yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Birdlip was hidden behind his paper, but something in the angle at
      which the sheets were held led Sanford to believe that the old gentleman
      was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Edwards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What's next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's this letter from Lord Southpeak of the London <i>Gazette</i>
      asking if he can see you when he comes over next month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cable Southpeak I shall be very happy to see him if he gets here before
      the fifteenth. I am going on my vacation then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The attentive Edwards scribbled rapidly in his notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just pick out the most urgent stuff,&rdquo; said Sanford. &ldquo;I don't care to
      bother with anything that isn't really pressing. I've got an important
      conference on in New York to-day, and I want to keep my mind clear.
      Blackwit of the Associated Press has asked me to say a few words to his
      directors on 'Journalism as a Function of Public Conscience'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwards ran rapidly through an imposing mass of documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That long-distance call from the Chicago <i>Vox</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      promised to give Mr. Groton some word this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him up when we get to Penn. Station,&rdquo; said Sanford. &ldquo;Tell him I
      can't give him any decision yet awhile. Tell him that loyalty to my own
      city will keep me there for some time. You might tell him that I believe
      the <i>Lens</i> has great possibilities if properly handled. I should not
      care to build up the property of a Chicago paper while there is a chance
      of the <i>Lens</i> becoming the great evening paper of the East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Edwards, jotting down what, might pass for stenography.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was running smoothly through level green country, and Mr.
      Birdlip laid down his paper on his lap. Sanford was ready to catch his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Birdlip,&rdquo; he said, genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the owner of the <i>Lens</i>, whose bright gaze
      exhibited a lively tincture of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the typed notes of your remarks on 'Newspaper Circulation as a
      Byproduct of the Multiplication Table',&rdquo; said Edwards, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can let those wait,&rdquo; said Sanford, carelessly. &ldquo;I don't want to be
      bothered with anything else this morning. Give me a memorandum of anything
      that needs to be attended to when we get to New York.&rdquo; He turned to Mr.
      Birdlip. &ldquo;I find that in these busy days one has to attend to some of
      one's work even on the train. It is about the only place where one is
      never interrupted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I hear you say something about Circulation?&rdquo; said Mr. Birdlip. &ldquo;Are
      you specially interested in that problem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given it a good deal of thought,&rdquo; said Sanford. &ldquo;But I would
      hardly dignify it by calling it a problem. It is perfectly simple. It is
      purely a matter of taking the right attitude toward it. So many newspaper
      proprietors regard it merely as a problem in addition. Now it should be
      considered rather as a matter of multiplication. Instead of trying to add
      ten to your figures, why not multiply by ten? The result is so much more
      satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sounded so plausible that Mr. Birdlip felt ashamed to ask how it was
      to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a cigar, sir?&rdquo; asked Sanford, handing out the only one with
      a band on it. Mr. Birdlip accepted it, and looked as though he were about
      to ask a question. Sanford went on rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of circulation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I am consulted I am always
      surprised to note that newspaper proprietors are so prone to view the
      matter merely as a question of distribution; of&mdash;well, of
      merchandising,&rdquo; he added, as his eye fell upon that word in his copy of <i>System</i>.
      &ldquo;Indeed it rests upon quite another basis. The essence of merchandising&rdquo;
       (he repeated the word with relish, noting its soothing effect on his
      employer) &ldquo;is what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a dramatic pause, and Mr. Birdlip, carried away, wondered what
      indeed was the essence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The essence of merchandising,&rdquo; said Sanford (he smote the arm of his
      chair, and leaned forward in emphasis), &ldquo;and by merchandising I mean of
      course in the modern sense, merchandising on a big scale, is nothing but
      Confidence. Confidence, an impalpable thing, a state of mind. Now, sir,
      what is it that upbuilds circulation? It is Public Confidence. The
      assurance on the part of the public that the newspaper is reliable. It is
      a secret and inviolable conviction on the part of the reader that the
      integrity and enterprise of the paper are beyond cavil, in other words,
      unimpeachable. In order to create the Will-to-Purchase on the part of the
      prospect, in order to beget that desirable state of mind, there must be a
      state of mind in the paper itself. Note that word <i>Mind</i>. Now what is
      the Mind of the paper? I always ask every newspaper owner who consults me,
      what is the Mind of his paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for Mr. Birdlip to be embarrassed by his inability to
      answer this question, the ecstatic Sanford continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mind of the paper is, of course, the Editorial Department. How
      subtle, how delicate, how momentous, is that function of commenting on the
      great affairs of the world! As I said in an address to a Rotary club
      recently, of what use to have all the mechanical perfections ever invented
      unless your editors are the right men? Walter Whitman, the efficiency
      engineer, said: 'Produce great persons: the rest follows.' That is the
      kind of production that counts most. Get great personalities for your
      editors, and watch the circulation rise. Of course the right kind of
      editors must be very highly paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a strange doctrine to Mr. Birdlip, who never read the editorial
      page of his own paper, and secretly wondered how the editors found so much
      to write about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great error that so many newspaper owners make,&rdquo; said Sanford,
      sonorously, &ldquo;is to think of their product as they would of any other
      article of commerce which is turned out day by day, in standardized units,
      from a factory. A newspaper is not standardized. It is born anew every
      issue. It is not a manufacturing routine that puts it together: it is a
      human organism, built up out of human brains. Every unit is different. It
      depends not primarily on machinery but on human personalities. I cannot
      understand why it is that newspaper owners yearn for the finest and most
      modern presses, and yet are often content to staff their journals with
      second-rate men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; said Mr. Birdlip. &ldquo;It is all a question of getting the
      right man. That is one reason why I am so fond of travelling; I always
      meet up with new ideas. Now, sir (I am sorry I do not know your name, for
      your face is rather familiar; I think I must have met you at some Rotary
      club), you seem to me a man of forceful and aggressive character. You are
      the kind of man I should like to have on the <i>Lens</i>, I heard you
      mention the paper to your secretary awhile back; you must be interested in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanford was perfectly cool. &ldquo;I might consider it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you would find the <i>Lens</i> a pleasant paper to work on,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Birdlip. &ldquo;I flatter myself that the staff is a capable one, for the
      most part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should insist on being given a free hand,&rdquo; said Sanford. &ldquo;Perhaps the
      position of circulation manager&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think a moment,&rdquo; said Mr. Birdlip. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to visit
      with my editor-in-chief before firing any one to make room for you. But I
      must say I like the way you talk, straight from the shoulder, like that
      Dr. Cranium, you know. That's the sort of stuff we need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; cried Sanford. &ldquo;If you always talk straight from the shoulder,
      you'll never talk through your hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Birdlip relished this impromptu aphorism. &ldquo;Well, now, let me see,&rdquo; he
      said, pondering. &ldquo;The editor-in-chief, the managing editor, the editorial
      writers&mdash;they're all pretty good men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I shouldn't care for a merely routine position,&rdquo; said Sanford.
      &ldquo;The only position I would consider would be one in which I could really
      build up circulation for you.&rdquo; He was wondering inwardly whether to stand
      out for a ten thousand salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mr. Birdlip. &ldquo;I think I have it. How would you care to
      run a column? 'Straight From the Shoulder'&mdash;wouldn't that be a fine
      title?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Sanford, but not without a secret shudder. Still, he thought,
      gold can assuage anything; and he reflected on the rich, sedentary, and
      care-free life of a syndicated philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the owner. &ldquo;I've been looking around for a man with both
      feet on the ground&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Both feet on the pay envelope is my idea,&rdquo; said Sanford to himself.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think you're just the man I want. There's only one place in the
      paper I can think of that really needs a change. There's a fellow on the
      staff called Sanford, runs a kind of column, terrible stuff. I don't think
      he amounts to much. Now why couldn't you take his job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanford has never forgiven his brother-in-law for that curious strangled
      sound he emitted.

      THE CLIMACTERIC
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. EUSTACE VEAL
      was a manufacturer of cuspidors. His beautiful factory was one of the
      finest of its kind, equipped with complete automatic sprinklers,
      wire-glass windows, cafeteria on the top floor, pensions for superannuated
      employees, rosewood directors' dining room, mottoes from Orison Swett
      Marden on the weekly pay envelopes, and a clever young man in
      tortoise-shell spectacles hired at eighty dollars a week to write the
      house-organ (which was called <i>El Cuspidorado</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Veal lived in the exclusive and clean-shaven suburb of Mandrake Park,
      where he had built a stucco mansion with Venetian blinds, a croquet lawn
      with a revolving spray on it on hot days, and a mansard butler. Here Mrs.
      Veal and the two Veal girls, Dora and Petunia, led the blameless life of
      the <i>embonpoint</i> classes. The electric lights in the bedrooms were
      turned on promptly at ten o'clock every night, except on the sixteen
      winter evenings when the Veals occupied their box at the opera. During
      &ldquo;Rigoletto&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pagliacci&rdquo; the uncomplaining Mr. Veal would sit in silence
      with his head against the thick red velvet curtain at the back of the box,
      thinking up new ways to get an order for ten thousand nickel-plated
      seamless number 13's from the Pullman Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Veal, hampered as he was by the restrictions of success, was still
      full of the enjoyment of life. He had written a little brochure on &ldquo;The
      Cuspidor: Its Use and Abuse Since the Times of the Pharaohs,&rdquo; which was
      very well spoken of in the trade. A morocco-bound copy lay on the console
      table in Mrs. Veal's salon. It was he who invented the papier-maché
      spittoon, and the collapsible paper &ldquo;companion&rdquo; for travelling salesmen.
      It was he who had presented a solid silver spittoon de luxe to the King of
      Siam when that worthy visited the United States. And it was his idea, too,
      to name the beautiful shining brass model, especially recommended for
      hotel lobbies, El Cuspidorado. This was a stroke of imaginative genius,
      and several rival manufacturers wept because they had not thought of it
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spittoon magnate's habits were regular and sane. He rose by alarm
      clock at seven. He bathed, shaved, brushed his teeth with the vertical
      motion recommended by the toothbrush advertisers, breakfasted on cereal
      and cream and poached eggs, with one cup of strong coffee; walked
      leisurely to the station, bought a paper, and caught the 8.13 train. He
      avoided the other men who wanted him to sit with them, took the fifth
      chair on the left-hand side of the smoking car, and just as the train
      started he lit his first cigar. His commutation ticket was always ready
      for the conductor to punch. He never kept others waiting, just as he hated
      to be kept waiting himself. After his ticket had been punched and put back
      into an alligator-hide pocketbook, he opened the paper and studied it
      faithfully until the train got to the terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the factory Mr. Veal's routine was equally well-ordered and uniform. At
      nine o'clock he reached his private office, greeted his secretary, and ran
      over the morning mail, which had been opened and lay on his desk. Then he
      went through his dictation, which was carefully (even if not
      grammatically) accomplished. The sales reports for the preceding day were
      brought to him. Then he discussed any matters requiring attention with his
      department heads, calling them in one by one. At a quarter after twelve he
      walked up to the Manufacturers' Club for lunch, after which he played one
      game of pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back at the office by half-past two, and gave his passionate and
      devoted attention to the salivary needs of the nation until five o'clock.
      He caught the 5.23 train back to Mandrake Park, sitting on the right-hand
      side of the smoker where the setting sun would not dazzle on his
      newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day, about the time of the March equinox, when young ladies put
      furry pussywillows on their typewriter desks, and bank tellers crack the
      shells of spring jokes through the brass railings, Mr. Veal's behaviour
      was so peculiar as to cause anxiety among his associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ridden on the train as usual, without showing any abnormal
      symptoms. But when he was next observed, walking down Vincent Street,
      there was a red spot on his cheekbones and his expression was savage. He
      entered a haberdasher's shop and asked to see some neckties. When the
      clerk put out a tray of silk scarves in rich, sober colours, such as are
      commonly worn by successful and middle-aged merchants, Mr. Veal swore and
      dashed them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I'm not going to a funeral! Things like that are
      worn by Civil War veterans. What do you think I am, seventy years old?
      Give me something with some snap to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he chose a lemon-tinted cravat with vorticist patterns of brown and
      purple. He tore off the dark gray tie he had on and substituted the gaudy
      new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next corner he passed a shoe-shop. He hesitated a moment at the
      plate-glass window, then he entered and glared at the brisk young puppet
      who came forward with a smirk. He displayed his elastic-sided boots of the
      floorwalker type (which he had worn for years on account of his corns) and
      asked to have them removed. When they were off his feet he threw them to
      the other end of the long, narrow room. &ldquo;I want some russet shoes with
      cloth tops,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And some silk socks to match, the kind the men wear
      in the magazine ads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he left the shop, his feet might have been taken for those of Charley
      Chaplin, or of an assistant advertising manager of a department store.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Veal reached his office nearly two hours late, and one of his office
      boys was instantly discharged for asking him whom he wanted to see.
      Indeed, in a new suit of violent black-and-white checks, and with a crush
      hat of velvety substance, he was almost unrecognizable. As he passed
      through the filing department a hush fell over the young ladies there. His
      secretary, looking nervously from her corner outside the private office,
      felt a tingling <i>scherzo</i> run up and down the keyboard of her spine.
      Never before had she seen Mr. Veal wear flowers in his buttonhole, and as
      he swung the door of his office behind him, she sniffed the vibrating air.
      In the rich wake of cigar-fragrance always exhaled by her employer her
      sharp nostrils detected a new tang&mdash;the sweet scent of mignonette.
      Heavens! Was Mr. Veal using perfume?
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stafford was an acute young woman. She had long been waiting the
      adroit moment to push her employer for a raise, which was indeed due her.
      She determined that this was the psychological day. When the sign of the
      Ram is ascendant in the zodiac, let employers tremble. This is when even
      the most faithful and long-enduring wage-earner dreams seditiously of a
      fatter manila envelope. Miss Stafford's typewriter had sung like a zither
      for a number of years, she had orchestrated many curious harmonies on it,
      and now she had reached the point where she was almost as indispensable to
      the business as Mr. Veal himself. She was carrying what the efficiency
      dopesters call the peak load.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buzzer buzzed, and Miss Stafford hastened to the private office,
      nerving herself to throw cantilevers across the Rubicon.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her surprise, Mr. Veal, instead of sitting glowering over the morning
      mail, was standing by the window, throwing a paper-weight in the air and
      failing to catch it. The sunlight blazing through the large windows seemed
      to surround his emphatic clothes with a prismatic fringe. To her
      amazement, instead of the customary brief and reserved greeting, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Miss Stafford. Great weather, eh? Sorry I'm late, but I just
      couldn't keep my schedule this morning. Went out to buy myself some golf
      clubs. I think I'd better take up the game, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a swing at an imaginary golf ball, and slipped on the polished
      floor, nearly falling down. He recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's some flowers for you,&rdquo; he said, taking a bunch of daffodils from
      the desk. &ldquo;Daffy-down-dillies, as the poets call 'em. Lovely flowers, hey?
      Now comes in the sweet of the year. What ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced toward her, and for one extraordinary moment she thought he
      was about to chuck her under the chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Mr. Foster to come in,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Veal,&rdquo; she said, nervously, &ldquo;there's just one thing&mdash;I wanted to
      ask you about, my salary, don't you think, er, I think, it seems to me
      about time I had a raise. I've been here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never thought of it. Why, of course, you're
      right. Miss Stafford, how old would you say I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stafford knew perfectly well that he was fifty-five, but she had
      learned the cunning of all women who have to manage men, whether those men
      be husbands, employers, or ticket scalpers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Veal, in a good light and in your new suit, I should say about
      thirty-nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you getting now, Miss Stafford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Mr. Mason to double it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feminine mind moves in rapid zigzags, and Miss Stafford's first
      conscious and coherent thought was of a certain woollen sports suit she
      had seen in a window on Vincent Street marked $50.00.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by the way,&rdquo; said Mr. Veal, &ldquo;when you see Mr. Mason, tell him I've
      got a new motto for next week's pay envelopes. Here it is; I found it in
      the paper this morning. I don't know who wrote it&mdash;better have him
      credit it to Orison Swett Marden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed her a slip of paper, on which he had copied out:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For in my youth I never did apply
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The means of weakness and debility.
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &mdash;Orison Swett Marden (?)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you call Mr. Foster,&rdquo; said the secretary, &ldquo;Mr. Schmaltz of the
      Pullman Company is here to see you; he arrived just before you came in. He
      says he wants to place a large order for the cuspidorados.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him in,&rdquo; said Mr. Veal, chuckling. &ldquo;Hello, Schmaltz,&rdquo; he cried, as
      the customer entered. &ldquo;How's this for weather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great stuff!&rdquo; said Schmaltz. &ldquo;Makes us old fellows feel almost young
      again, doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Veal's face grew dark. He aged ten years in the instant. He pointed
      morosely to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Veal,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we want to place an order for ten thousand of
      the cuspidorados. Can you give us the old price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can <i>not</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Veal, shortly. &ldquo;Materials have gone to the
      sky. I can't give you the&mdash;the old price. I'll give you a young
      price, a very young one indeed, based on the present state of the market.
      Eighteen and a quarter cents is the best I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schmaltz raised racial hands. &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you used to let us
      have them for fourteen and a half. Why, in the old days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Veal pounded the desk with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you use that world <i>old</i> again, I'll assassinate you with a dish
      of ham!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Great pigs' knuckles, what do you think this is, a
      home for the aged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mr. Schmaltz had gone Mr. Veal sent for Foster, the foreman of the
      manufacturing department.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how about those machines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Veal,&rdquo; said Foster, &ldquo;we'll have to replace at least six of those
      Victor stampers. They're so old they simply can't do the work. You know
      when one of those machines is over five years old&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Veal was pointing to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At lunch-time Mr. Veal went up to the club as usual. Swinging up the
      street, in the bright sun and pellucid air, he felt quite cheerful, and
      stopped to buy himself a rhinoceros cane. In the dining room of the club
      he met Edwards, and they sat down together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old man,&rdquo; said Edwards. &ldquo;You're looking chipper for a veteran.
      Played any golf yet this year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't play,&rdquo; said Mr. Veal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you? That's a mistake. It's the only game for us older fellows. Of
      course we can't score like the youngsters; but still we can get round and
      have a deal of fun&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Veal clenched his fists. Spilling his soup, he leaped up and rushed
      from the room. He seized his coat and hat, forgetting the new cane, and
      fled to the nearest Turkish bath.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And all because, when going downstairs in the railway terminal that
      morning, he had heard a man behind him say to another:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes Veal! He's beginning to look old, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time in his life Mr. Veal had heard the damnable
      adjective applied to himself in earnest.

    <h2>
      PUNCH AND JUDY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Judy Cronin
      first saw the topless towers of Manhattan rising into the lilac vagueness
      of a foggy winter morning she passed into a numb and frightened daze.
      Standing on the steerage deck of the <i>Celtic</i>, she peered tremulously
      at those fantastic impossible profiles of stone. Perhaps you don't know
      what it is to be thrown, ignorant and timid, into a place where everything
      is utterly strange&mdash;particularly a place as huge, violent, and hasty
      as New York. Judy, aged twenty-one, from a little village near Queenstown,
      was incapable of distinguishing, in the roaring voice of the city, that
      undertone of helpful kindness that is really there. On the same steamer
      came the widow of a famous Irish recusant and hungerstriker, and there
      were ten thousand people massed in West Street to cheer her. Judy heard
      the shouts of the crowd, and saw the lines of policemen on the pier. There
      was some of that quiet but menacing scuffling with which the various
      branches of the English-speaking world show their esteem for each other.
      Judy was not familiar with that definition of a patriot as one who makes
      trouble for his harmless fellow-citizens; but it looked as though she was
      blundering into some more of the tribulations they had had at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last her sister Connie found her, sitting white and miserable on her
      very small trunk, clutching her imitation-silver coin-purse. Connie had
      been in New York for a couple of years, and it gave her a homesick throb
      to see that coin-purse&mdash;one of those little metal pocketbooks with
      slots to hold gold sovereigns and half-sovereigns. Father Daly had given
      it to Judy, years ago, but it had never had gold in the little sockets
      until Connie sent over the passage money to bring Judy to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city flashed by like a current-events film. Judy found herself in a
      friendly lodging-house in Brooklyn, kept by an Irishwoman who had been
      kind to Connie. Her sister then explained matters. Her own employers, with
      whom she had a position too good to abandon, had arranged to go South for
      the latter part of the winter. They had already delayed leaving so that
      Connie could meet her sister and get her settled. They had given Connie a
      few days' holiday for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Judy must get a place as soon as possible. And that very
      afternoon the sisters (Judy still in a kind of dreadful dream) went to the
      office of a Brooklyn newspaper to insert an advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great many people were watching the <i>Situations Wanted</i> columns,
      and the next evening, at supper-time, Mrs. Leland called up the
      lodging-house number, which had been given in the ad. Connie went to the
      telephone. Mrs. Leland had a pleasant voice and &ldquo;talked like gentry&rdquo;,
      Connie said. She lived in Heathwood, Long Island, which is some twenty
      miles from town, and wanted a nurse to take care of two children. Connie
      agreed to take Judy out to Heathwood the next morning, to see if they
      could come to terms. Judy was inexperienced, but Mrs. Leland liked her
      looks. In short: by the time Judy had been in America three days, she was
      installed at Mrs. Leland's home in the country; and a few days later
      Connie had gone off to Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Judy was really very fortunate in these random proceedings, for she
      had found a good home under an exceptionally kind and understanding
      mistress. And therefore perhaps it was unreasonable of her to be so
      unhappy. But no one has ever demonstrated that human affairs are much
      controlled by reason. Judy was dumbly and piteously miserable. She was
      homesick and lonely, and half-mad with strangeness. She was not really
      slow-witted; but the confusion of her spirits put her into a kind of black
      stupor. Everything was uncouth to her: steam heat, electric light,
      gas-stove, telephone&mdash;even the alarm clock in her bedroom. Not
      knowing how to turn off her radiator, and having the simple person's
      distrust of opening windows in a strange place, the first few nights she
      was sick with heat and suffocation. In her sleep she cried out
      indistinguishable words about being shot. In spite of Mrs. Leland's
      patient tuition, she made every possible kind of mistake. The children,
      with the quickness of youth, realized her inexperience and uncertainty,
      and played a thousand impish pranks. Mrs. Leland could see that the girl
      had been through distresses at home, and kept the evening papers, with
      their headlines about Ireland, out of sight. But one evening, in the
      kitchen, Judy came upon a Sunday rotogravure section with pictures of
      burnt streets in Cork. The look of the people in those photographs went
      through her heart. The men wearing caps, the women in shawls, something
      even in the shape of trouser legs and heavy shoes, reminded Judy how far
      she was from all that she understood. It's the little things you take for
      granted at home that come back to hurt you when you're away. That night,
      sitting in her bedroom next the nursery, she shook herself ill with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who might have helped her greatly took pains to add to her
      bewilderment. Hattie, Mrs. Leland's coloured cook, a retainer of long
      standing, was sharply disgruntled at this new addition to the household.
      Jealousy was the root of Hattie's irritation, and it shot up a rapid
      foliage of poison ivy. The previous nurse, a bosom friend of Hattie's own
      race, had been discharged in December for incompetence. Moreover, Hattie
      had not forgotten poor naïve Judy's startled look when they first
      encountered. Judy had hardly seen a coloured person before, and was
      honestly alarmed. Hattie, though loyal to Mrs. Leland in her own primitive
      fashion, deeply resented this interloper. The invasion proved that Mrs.
      Leland was no longer entirely dependent on the particular clique of
      Heathwood coloured society in which Hattie moved. The cook's logic was
      narrow but rigorous. The sooner the intruder could be discouraged out of
      the house, the sooner the Black Hussars (as Heathwood ladies called the
      coloured colony on whom they largely relied for assistance) would resume
      undivided sway. Mrs. Leland had had a Polish girl as a stop-gap for a few
      days after the coloured nurse left; and observing the cook's demeanour
      toward this unfortunate, Mr. Leland had remarked that Hattie was working
      for a black Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hattie, who was sharp-tongued and very capable, hectored Judy whenever
      she entered the kitchen, and by all the black arts at her command (which
      were many) added to the girl's distress. Judy, in spite of her mistress's
      kindness, grew more and more wretched. As Mr. Leland said in private
      (pursuing the train of his previous pun), the maids were black and blue.
      Mrs. Leland, much goaded by domestic management and the care of a very
      small baby, began to wonder whether she had not added another child to
      look after rather than lightening her burdens. And then she saw that Judy
      was on the verge of nervous collapse. She tried to hearten the girl by
      giving her an extra holiday. Judy was given some money, packed off to the
      station in a taxi, and sent on her maiden trip to town in the hope that
      city sights and shop windows would revive her interest in life. Mrs.
      Flaherty, the lodging-house lady in Brooklyn, was telephoned to, and
      promised to send her small boy to meet the girl at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to be the eve of the genial Saint Valentine's Day. Shop
      windows were gay with pleasantly exaggerated symbols of his romantic
      power. Winter afternoons in the city are cruel to the unfortunate, for the
      throng of the streets the light and lure of the scene, make loneliness all
      the worse if there is trouble in your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judy sat in the waiting room of the Long Island terminal in Brooklyn, and
      tears were on her face. She had somehow missed Mrs. Flaherty's lad. Then
      she had tried to find her way to the lodging-house, but grew more and more
      frightened and bewildered as she strayed. Giving that up, she had gone
      into a movie, and there, for a while, she had been happy. The favourites
      of the screen are the true internationalists: they speak a language, crude
      though it often is, which is known from Brooklyn to Bombay. But then
      pictures were shown of scenes in Ireland. She came out with cold hands,
      and wandered vaguely along the streets until dusk. Finally, in despair,
      she groped back to the station at Flatbush Avenue, and sat forlornly on a
      bench, too weary and sorry even to ask how to get home.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the unerring instinct of the stranger for choosing the wrong place,
      she had blundered into the downstairs station, by the train-gates, missing
      the waiting room above where departures are duly announced by orotund men
      in blue and silver. In that chilly cavern she sat, dumbly watching the
      press of homeward commuters laden with parcels and papers. Red signboards
      clattered up and down over the iron gates, and she puzzled doubtfully over
      such names as <i>Speonk</i>, and <i>Far Rockaway</i>. The last somehow
      recalled a nursery rhyme and made her feel even more lost and homesick.
      Occasionally, with a gentle groan and rumble, an electric train slid up to
      the railing and stared at her with two fierce hostile eyes. The soda
      fountain in the corner was doing a big business: timidly she went over,
      feeling cold, and asked for tea. To her amazement, there were no hot
      drinks to be had. The people, all gulping iced mixtures, stared at her
      curiously. Sure, this is a mad country, she thought. The clock telling the
      time was the only thing she could properly understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was the clock, at last, that brought her to startled action. It was
      getting late. A tall, good-looking fellow in a blue uniform came out of a
      room at the back of the station, carrying two lighted lanterns. He halted
      not far from where she was sitting, and compared his watch with the
      Western Union clock. Of all the hundreds she had seen, he was the first
      who looked easily questionable. With a sudden impulse Judy got up,
      clutching her coin-purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, where will I be after taking the train to Heathwood?&rdquo; she
      said, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heathwood? The 6:18 makes Heathwood. Right over there, the gate's just
      opening. Change at Jamaica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her, wondering but kindly. He was puzzled at the
      frightened way she was staring at his coat-collar; he could hardly have
      guessed that to wet eyes the embroidered letters had at first seemed to be
      <i>liar</i>. Her puny, pinched face was streaked with tears, the red
      knitted muffler made her pallor even whiter. The little imitation fur
      trimmings on her coat sleeves and collar were worn and shabby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, blindly, and started off for the wrong gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he called, and overtook her in a few long strides. &ldquo;This way, miss.
      Got your ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a sudden panic she opened her purse, and could not find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, surely I've lost it,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where's the booking office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The booking office?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;D'you mean the news-stand? Here you are.&rdquo;
       He picked up the ticket, which she had dropped in her nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; he said, encouragingly. &ldquo;This train, over here. I'm
      one of the crew. I'll see you get there. Don't worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He escorted her through the gate, and found her a seat on the train,
      beside a stout commuter half buried in parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you stay right here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll tell you when we get to Jamaica,
      and show you the Heathwood train.&rdquo; He smiled genially, and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judy got out her wet handkerchief and wiped her face. As the train ran
      through the tunnel, she wished she had been on the inside of the seat, for
      the dark window would have been useful as a mirror. &ldquo;He saw me crying,&rdquo;
       she kept repeating to herself. The man beside her blanketed himself with a
      newspaper, and the pile of packages on his knees kept sliding over onto
      her lap, but she was oblivious. She was thinking of the tall man in blue
      with the queer cap. How kind he had been. The first real kindness she had
      met in all that nightmare afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he came through the car. She could see him far down the aisle,
      leaning courteously over each seat. At first she thought he was just
      saying a friendly word to all the passengers. Sure, that's like him, she
      said to herself: he has a grand way with him. Then she saw that he was
      punching tickets with a silver clipper. Glory, it's the Guard himself, she
      thought. I wonder will he speak to me again?
    </p>
    <p>
      The man beside her thrust an arm out from his mass of bundles and held a
      large oblong of red-striped cardboard across in front of her face. This
      reminded Judy of her own ticket, which was so different from her
      neighbour's that she worried for a moment lest it should not be valid.
      Here was her friend, bending above her with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The next stop's Jamaica. That's where
      you get off. Watch for me at this door, and I'll show you the Heath-wood
      train.&rdquo; Click, click: the two tickets were punched, and he went on. Judy
      shut up her coin purse with a snap, and began to notice the hat worn by
      the lady in the seat in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Jamaica she found him in the vestibule, his head overtopping the
      pushing crowd. &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said, and led her quickly across the
      platform. &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; he said to the brakeman on the other train, &ldquo;tell this
      lady when you get to Heathwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Judy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Leland when her nursemaid got back to the house.
      &ldquo;How much better you look! Did you have a good time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a grand time,&rdquo; said Judy. Her face had a touch of colour and indeed
      even her awkward bog-trotting gait seemed lighter and more sprightly.
      &ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; said her mistress. &ldquo;You'd better run down and get some
      supper before Hattie puts everything away. You can put Jack to bed after
      you've had something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty late for supper,&rdquo; grumbled Hattie, as Judy came into the kitchen.
      &ldquo;Doan' you think I got nothing to do but wait on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get my own supper,&rdquo; said Judy, politely. &ldquo;Don't you bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a head on your shoulders,&rdquo; said Hattie, banging some dishes on
      to the kitchen table. &ldquo;Whyn't you use it and get back on time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black banshee's up in arms again,&rdquo; said Judy to herself. &ldquo;I'll hold
      my peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the trouble with foreigners,&rdquo; growled Hattie. &ldquo;They ain't got no
      sense. These Irish micks come over here, puttin' on airs, where nobody
      wants 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judy's sallow cheek began to burn a darker tint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, nabocklish!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There's somebody loves me, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried through supper, and ran upstairs to put Jack to bed. The
      six-year-old was amusing himself by snapping open and shut something that
      gleamed in the lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What are you doing with Judy's purse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack looked up in surprise. It was the first time that he had heard that
      note of command in the meek Judy's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it on your bureau,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, leave it be, darlin'.&rdquo; She took it from him. &ldquo;Glory above, what's
      become of&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell on her knees on the floor and began searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here, 'tis!&rdquo; she cried, gladly. From the rug she picked up a tiny red
      cardboard heart, and replaced it carefully in one of the sockets of her
      purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Jack, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, it's my Valentine!&rdquo; said Judy. &ldquo;It ain't many girls that gets a
      Valentine from a big handsome man like that the first time he sees them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have often wondered how many of the Long Island trainmen use a
      heart-shaped punch.

    <h2>
      REFERRED TO THE AUTHOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ES, &ldquo;Obedience&rdquo; is
      a fine play. I'm glad they've revived it. Did you know that the first time
      it was produced, Morgan Edwards played the part of Dunbar? It's rather an
      odd story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never think of Edwards without remembering the dark, creaky stairs in
      that boarding-house on Seventy-third Street. That was where I first met
      him. We had a comical habit of always encountering on the stairs. We would
      pass with that rather ridiculous murmur and sidling obeisance of two
      people who don't know each other but want to be polite. I was interested
      in him at once. Even on the shadowy stairway I could see that he had a
      fine head, and there was something curiously attractive about his pale,
      preoccupied face. There was a touch of the unworldly about him, and a
      touch of the tragic, too. You know how you divine things about people. &ldquo;He
      has troubles of his own&rdquo; was the banal phrase that came into my mind. Also
      there was something queerly familiar about him. I wondered if I had seen
      Him before, or only imagined him. I was busy writing, at that time, and my
      mind was peopled with energetic phantoms. The thought struck me that
      perhaps he was someone I had invented for a story, but had never given
      life to. I wondered, was this pale and rather reproachful spectre going to
      haunt me until the tale was written? At any rate, whatever the story was,
      I had forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as I creaked up the first flight, I saw that he was standing at
      the head of the stairs, waiting for me to pass. A door was open behind
      him, and there was light enough to see him clearly. Tall, thin,
      beautifully shaven on a fine angular jaw that would not be easy to shave,
      I was surprised to see an air of sudden cheerfulness about him that was
      almost incongruous. Having thought of him only as a sort of melancholy
      hallucination living on a dingy stairway, it was quite startling to see
      him with his face lit up like a lyric poet's, a glow of mundane
      exhilaration in his eyes. For the first time in our meetings he looked as
      though to speak to him would not break in upon his secret thoughts. He was
      the kind of chap, you know, who usually looked as though he was busy
      thinking. I remember what I said because it was so inane. Some people
      don't like to cross on the stairs. I looked up as I came to the turn in
      the steps, and said, &ldquo;Superstitious?&rdquo; He smiled and said &ldquo;No, I guess
      not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in the literal sense, at this moment,&rdquo; I said. An absurd remark, and
      a horrible pun which I regretted at once, for I thought I would have to
      explain it. Nothing more humiliating than having to explain a bad pun. But
      if I didn't explain it, it would seem rude. He looked puzzled, then his
      face lit up charmingly. &ldquo;Superstitious&mdash;standing above you, eh? I
      never thought of the meaning before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I came up the last steps. &ldquo;Pardon the vile pun,&rdquo; I said. Then I knew where
      I had seen him before, and recognized him. &ldquo;Aren't you Morgan Edwards?&rdquo; I
      asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. I remember you in 'After Dinner'. I wrote the notice in the
      <i>Observer</i> .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, did you? I <i>am</i> glad to meet you. I think that was the
      nicest thing any one ever said.&rdquo; His gaunt and pensive face showed a quick
      flash of that direct and honest friendliness which is so appealing. We
      found that we were both living on the fourth floor. For similar reasons,
      undoubtedly. I'm afraid he thought, at first, that I was a dramatic critic
      of standing. Afterward I explained that the &ldquo;After Dinner&rdquo; notice had been
      only a fluke. I was on the <i>Observer</i> when the show was put on, and
      one of the dramatic men happened to be ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait a minute: give me a chance! I'll tell it exactly as it came to me, in
      snips and shreds. At first I didn't pay much attention. I had problems of
      my own that summer. You know what a fourth-floor hall bedroom is in hot
      weather. I had given up my newspaper job, and was trying to finish a
      novel. I couldn't work late at night, when it was cool, because if I kept
      my typewriter going after nine-thirty the old maid in the next room used
      to pound on the partition. I didn't get on very well with the work, and
      the money was running low. Every now and then I would meet Edwards in the
      hall. He looked ill and worried, and I used to think there was a touching
      pathos in his careful neatness. My own habits run the other way&mdash;my
      Palm Beach suit was a wreck, I remember&mdash;but Edwards was always
      immaculate. I could see&mdash;having made it my business to observe
      details&mdash;how cunningly he had mended his cuffs and soft collars. Poor
      devil! I used to see him going out about noon, with his cane and Panama
      hat. I dare say he scrubbed his hat with his toothbrush. Summer is a hard
      time for an actor who hasn't had a job all spring. Of course there are the
      pictures, and summer stock, but I gathered that he had been ill, and then
      had turned down several offers of that sort on account of something coming
      along that he had great hopes for. I remembered his really outstanding
      work in &ldquo;After Dinner&rdquo;, that satiric comedy that fell dead the winter
      before. Most of the critics gave it a good roasting, but knowing what I do
      now I expect the real trouble was poor direction. Fagan was the director,
      and what did he know of sophisticated comedy? As I say, I had reviewed the
      piece for the <i>Observer</i>, and had been greatly struck by Edwards's
      playing. Not a leading part, but exquisitely done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just at that time I was absorbed in my own not-too-successful affairs.
      For several years I had been saying to myself that I would do great stuff
      if I could only get away from the newspaper grind for a few months. And
      then, when I had saved up five hundred dollars, and buried myself there on
      Seventy-third Street to write, I couldn't seem to make any headway. I got
      half through the novel, and then saw that it was paltry stuff. It was
      flashy, spurious, and raw. One warm evening I was sitting at my window,
      smoking mournfully and watching some girls who were laughing and talking
      in a big apartment house that loomed over our lodgings like an ocean liner
      beside a tugboat. There was a tap at the door. Edwards asked if he could
      come in. I was surprised, and pleased. He kept very much to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Sit down and have a pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want to intrude,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just wanted to ask you something.
      You're a literary man. Do you know anything about Arthur Sampson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to confess that I had never heard the name. No one had, at that
      time, you remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's written a play,&rdquo; Edwards said. &ldquo;A perfectly lovely piece of work.
      I've got a part in it. By heaven, it seems too good to be true&mdash;after
      a summer like this: illness, the actors' strike, and all that&mdash;to get
      into something so fine. I've just read the whole script. I'm so keen about
      it, I'm eager to know who the author is. I thought perhaps you might know
      something about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he's a new man,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What's the play called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Obedience.' You know, I've never had such a stroke of luck&mdash;it's as
      if the part had been written for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; I said, and I was honestly pleased to hear of his good
      fortune. &ldquo;Is it the lead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Of course they want a big name for that. Brooks is the man. My
      part is only the foil&mdash;provides the contrast, you know&mdash;on the
      payroll as well as on the stage.&rdquo; He laughed, a little cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's producing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to tell me Upton's got anything good?&rdquo; I knew little
      enough about theatrical matters, but even outsiders know Upton's sort of
      producing, which mostly consists of musical shows where an atrocious
      libretto is pulled through by an opulent chorus and plenty of eccentric
      dancing. &ldquo;A chorus that outstrips them all&rdquo; was one of his favourite
      advertising slogans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I was wondering about the author, Sampson. This must be his
      first, or he'd never have given it to Upton. Or is Upton going to turn
      over a new leaf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only leaves Upton is likely to turn over are figleaves,&rdquo; I said,
      brutally. Upton's previous production had been called &ldquo;The Figleaf Lady&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the amazing part of it,&rdquo; said Edwards. &ldquo;This thing is really
      exquisite. It is beautifully written: quiet, telling, nothing irrelevant,
      not a false note. What will happen to it in Upton's hands, God knows. But
      he seems enthusiastic. He's a likable cutthroat: let's hope for the best.
      You're busy&mdash;forgive me for breaking in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, of course some of you have seen &ldquo;Obedience&rdquo; since that time, and you
      know that what Edwards told me was true. The play <i>was</i> lovely; not
      even Upton could kill it altogether. It was Sampson's first. Have any of
      you read it in printed form? It reads as well as it plays. And the part
      that Edwards was cast for&mdash;Dunbar&mdash;is, to any competent
      spectator, the centre of the action. You remember the lead: the cold,
      hard, successful hypocrite; and then Dunbar, the blundering, kindly
      simpleton whose forlorn attempts to create happiness for all about him
      only succeed in bringing disaster to the one he loves best. It's a great
      picture of a fine mind and heart, a life of rich, generous possibilities,
      frittered and wasted and worn out by the needless petty obstinacies of
      destiny. And all the tragedy (this was the superb touch) because the
      wretched soul never had courage enough to be unkind. What was it St. Paul,
      or somebody, said about not being disobedient to the heavenly vision?
      Dunbar, in the play, was obedient enough, and his heavenly vision made his
      life a hell. It was the old question of conflicting loyalties. How are you
      going to solve that?
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose the tragic farce is the most perfect conception of man's mind&mdash;outside
      the higher mathematics, I dare say. Everyone knows Sampson's touch now,
      but it was new then. Some of his situations came pretty close to the
      nerve-roots. The pitiful absurdity of people in a crisis, exquisite human
      idiocy where one can't smile because grotesque tragedy is so close...
      those were the scenes that Upton's director thought needed &ldquo;working up&rdquo;.
      But I'm getting ahead of my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now, let me see. I'd better be a little chronological. It must have
      been September, because I know I took Labour Day off and went to Long
      Beach for a swim. I had just about come to the conclusion that my novel
      was worthless, and that I'd better get a job of some sort. At the far end
      of the boardwalk, you remember, there's a quiet hotel where one gets away
      from the crowd, and where you see quite nice-looking people. After I'd had
      my swim, I thought I'd stroll up that way and have supper there. It's not
      a cheap place, but I had been living on lunch-counter food all summer, and
      I felt I owed myself a little extravagance. I was on my way along the
      boardwalk, enjoying the cool, strong whiff that comes off the ocean toward
      sunset, when I saw Edwards, on the other side of the promenade, walking
      with a girl. My eye caught his, and we raised our hats. I was going on,
      thinking that perhaps he wasn't so badly off as I had imagined, when to my
      surprise he ran after me. He looked very haggard and ill, and seemed
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it's frightfully awkward: I must have had my pocket
      picked somehow. I've lost my railroad tickets and everything. Could you
      possibly lend me enough to get back to town? I've got a lady with me,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn't need to count my money to know how much I had. It was just about
      five dollars, and, as you know, that doesn't go far at Long Beach. I told
      him how I stood. &ldquo;I can give you enough for the railroad fares, and glad
      to,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But how about supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we're not hungry,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we had a big lunch.&rdquo; I knew this was
      probably bravado, but I liked him for saying it. While I was feeling in my
      pocket for some bills, and wondering how to pass them over to him
      unobtrusively, he said, &ldquo;I'd like to introduce you to Miss Cunningham.
      We're going to be married in the autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may have seen Sylvia Cunningham? If so, you know how lovely she is.
      Not pretty but with the simple charm that beauty can't&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that's trite! She'll never be a great actress, but in the rôle of
      Sylvia Cunningham she's perfect. I hate to call her slender&mdash;it's
      such an overworked word, but what other is there? Dark hair and clear,
      amberlucent brown eyes, and a slow, searching way of talking, as if she
      were really trying to put thought into speech. She, too, poor child, had
      had a bad summer, I guessed: there was a neat little mend in her glove.
      She was very friendly&mdash;I think Edwards must have told her about that
      <i>Observer</i> notice. I saw that they were both much humiliated at their
      mishap, and I judged that genial frankness would carry off the situation
      best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life among the artists!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What are our assets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got seventeen cents,&rdquo; said Edwards. It was a mark of fine breeding,
      I thought, that he did not insist upon saying how much it was that he had
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cunningham began to open her purse. &ldquo;I have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What you have doesn't enter into the audit. In the
      vulgar phrase, your money's no good. I've got five dollars and a quarter.
      Now I suggest we go to Jamaica and get supper there, and then go back to
      town by trolley. It'll be an adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was what we did, and very jolly it was. You know how it is:
      artists and actors and manicure girls and newspapermen are accustomed to
      ups and downs of pocket; and when they have a misery in the right-hand
      trouser they make up for it in a spirit of genial comradeship. Jamaica is
      an entertaining place. In a little lunchroom, which I remembered from a
      time when I covered a story out that way, we had excellent ham and eggs,
      and a good talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat in that little white-tiled restaurant, I couldn't help watching
      Edwards. I don't know how to make this plain to you, but our talk, which
      was cheerful enough, was the least important part of the occasion. Talk
      tells so little, anyway: most of it's a mere stumbling in an almost
      foreign tongue when it comes to expressing the inward pangs and
      certainties that make up life. I had a feeling, as I saw those two, that I
      was coming closer than ever before to something urgent and fundamental in
      the human riddle. I thought that I had never seen a man so completely in
      love. When he looked at her there was a sort of&mdash;well, a sort of
      possession upon him, an enthusiasm, in the true sense of that strange
      word. I thought to myself that Keats must have looked at Fanny Brawne in
      just that way. And&mdash;you know what writers are&mdash;I must confess
      that my observation of these two began to turn into &ldquo;copy&rdquo; in my mind. I
      was wondering whether they might not give me a hint for my stalled novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some engaged couples that make it a point of honour to be a bit
      off-hand and jocose when any one else is with them. Just to show, I
      suppose, how sure they are of each other. And somehow I had expected
      actors, to whom the outward gestures of passion are a mere professional
      accomplishment, to be a little blasé or polished in such matters. But
      there was a perfect candour and simplicity about them that touched me
      keenly. Their relation seemed a lovely thing. Too lovely, and too intense
      perhaps, to be entirely happy, I thought, for I could see in Edwards's
      face that his whole life and mind were wrapped up in it. I may have been
      fanciful, but at that time I was seeing the human panorama not for itself
      but as a reflection of my own amateurish scribblings. In my novel I had
      been working on the theory&mdash;not an original one, of course&mdash;that
      the essence of tragedy is fixing one's passion too deeply on anything in
      life. In other words, that happiness only comes to those who do not take
      life too seriously. Destiny, determined not to give up its secrets, always
      maims or destroys those who press it too closely. As we laughed and
      enjoyed ourselves over our meal, I was wondering whether Edwards, with his
      strange air of honourable sorrow, was a proof of my doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we talked about the new play. Edwards had persuaded Upton to
      give Miss Cunningham a place in the cast, and she was radiant about it.
      Her eyes were like pansies as she spoke of it. I remember one thing she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it wonderful? Morgan and I are together again. You know how much it
      means to us, for if the show has a run we can get married this winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fall,&rdquo; Edwards amended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morgan's part is fine,&rdquo; she went on, after a look at him that made even a
      hardened reporter feel that he had no right to be there. &ldquo;It's really the
      big thing in the play for any one who can understand. It's just made for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was thoughtful a moment, and then added: &ldquo;It's <i>too much</i> made
      for him, that's the only trouble. You're living with him, Mr. Roberts.
      Don't let him take it too hard. He thinks of nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made some jocular remark, I forget what. Edwards was silent for a
      minute. Then he said: &ldquo;If you knew how I've longed for a part like that&mdash;a
      part that I could really lose myself in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't care,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to lose myself in a part. Suppose I couldn't
      find myself again when the time came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to me earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not an actor, Roberts, so perhaps you hardly understand what it
      means to find a play that's <i>real</i>&mdash;more real than everyday
      life. What I mean is this: everyday life is so damned haphazard, troubled
      by a thousand distractions and subject to every sort of cruel chance. We
      just fumble along and never know what's coming next. But in a play, a good
      play, it's all worked out beforehand, you can see the action progressing
      under clear guidance. What a relief it is to be able to sink yourself in
      your part, to live it and breathe it and get away for awhile from this
      pitiless self-consciousness that tags around with us. You remember what
      they used to say about Booth: that it wasn't Booth playing Hamlet, but
      Hamlet playing Booth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, I remember, I tied up my manuscript neatly in a brown paper
      parcel, marked it <i>Literary Remains of Leonard Roberts</i> (I was
      childish enough to think that the alliteration would please my literary
      executor, if there should be such a person), put it away in my trunk, and
      went down to Park Row to see if there were any jobs to be had. Of course
      it was the usual story. I had been out of the game for six months, and
      Park Row seemed to have survived the blow with great courage. At the <i>Observer</i>
      office they charitably gave me some books to review. As I came uptown on
      the subway I was reflecting on the change a few hours had made in my
      condition. That morning I had been an author, a novelist if you please;
      and now I was not even a reporter, but that most deplorable of all Grub
      Street figures, a hack reviewer. It was mid-afternoon, and I hadn't had
      any lunch yet. In a fit of sulks I went into Browne's, sat down in a
      corner, and ordered a chop and some shandygaff. As I ate, I looked over
      the books with a peevish eye. Never mind, I said to myself, I will write
      such brilliant, withering, and scorching reviews that in six months the
      Authors' League will be offering me hush money. I was framing the opening
      paragraph of my first article when Johnson, whom I had known on the <i>Observer</i>,
      stopped at my table. He was one of the newspaper men who had left Park Row
      to go into professional publicity work. There had been a time when I
      sneered at such a declension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Leonard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What are you doing nowadays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him, irritably, that I was writing a serial for one of the women's
      magazines. There is no statement that puts envious awe into a newspaper
      man so surely as that. But I also admitted that if he knew of a good job I
      might be persuaded to listen to details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it happens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do. Upton, the theatrical producer, is
      looking for a press agent. He tells me he's got something unusual under
      way, and he wants a highbrow blurb-artist. He says his regular roughneck
      is no good for this kind of show. Something by a new writer, rather out of
      Upton's ordinary line, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it 'Obedience'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it. I couldn't remember the name.&rdquo; As soon as I had finished my
      lunch I went round to Upton's office. It was high up in a building
      overlooking Longacre Square, where the elevators were crowded with the
      people of that quaint and spurious world. The men I found particularly
      fascinating&mdash;you know the type, so very young in figure, often so old
      and hard and dry in face, with their lively tweeds, starched blue or green
      collars, silver-gray ties, and straight-brushed, purply-black hair. It was
      my first introduction to the realms of theatrical producing, and I must
      confess that I found Mr. Upton's office very entertaining with its air of
      elaborate and transparent bunkum. I sat underneath a coloured enlarged
      photo of the Garden of Eden ballet in &ldquo;The Figleaf Lady&rdquo; and surveyed the
      small anteroom. It was all intensely unreal. Those framed photographs, on
      which were scrawled <i>To Harry Upton, the Best of His Kind</i>, or some
      such inscriptions, and signed by dramatists I had never heard of; the
      typist pounding out contracts; the architect's drawing of the projected
      Upton Theatre at Broadway and Fiftieth Street, showing a line of people at
      the box office&mdash;all this, I knew by instinct, meant nothing. The
      dramatists whose photographs I saw would never write a real play; the
      Upton Theatre, even if it should be built, would not house anything but
      &ldquo;burlettas,&rdquo; and the typed contracts were not worth so much carbon paper.
      As for Mr. Upton himself, one couldn't help loving him: he was such a
      disarming, enthusiastic, shrewd, unreliable bandit. To abbreviate, he took
      me on as a member of his &ldquo;publicity staff&rdquo; (consisting of myself and a
      typewriter, as far as I could see) at one hundred dollars a week. His
      private office had three ingenious exits; going out by one of them, I
      found myself in a little alcove with the typewriter and plenty of
      stationery. Rehearsals of &ldquo;Obedience&rdquo; had started that morning, Upton had
      told me; so before I went home that afternoon I had typed and sent off the
      following pregnant paragraph for the next day's papers:
    </p>

      Henry Upton's first dramatic production of the season, &ldquo;Obedience,&rdquo; by
      Arthur Sampson, began making elbow room for itself at rehearsals
      yesterday. Keith Brooks will play the leading rôle, supported by Lillian
      Llewellyn, Sylvia Cunningham, Morgan Edwards, and other distinguished
      players.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a feeling of cheerfulness that evening. The cursed novel was no
      longer on my mind, there would be a hundred dollars due me the next week,
      and I was about to satisfy my long-standing curiosity to know something
      about the theatre from the inside. It was one of those typical evenings of
      New York loveliness: a rich, tawny, lingering light, a dry, clear air,
      warm enough to be pleasantly soft and yet with a sharp tingle in the
      breeze. I strolled about that bright jolly neighbourhood round the hideous
      Verdi statue, bought a volume of Pinero's plays at one of those
      combination book, cigar, and toy shops, and as I sat in my favourite
      Milwaukee Lunch I believe (if I must be frank) that some idea of writing a
      play was flitting through my mind. I got back to my room about ten
      o'clock. I had just sat down to read Pinero when Edwards tapped at the
      door. My mouth was open to tell him my surprising news when I saw that he
      was unpleasantly agitated. First he insisted on returning my loan,
      although I begged him to believe that there need be no hurry about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rehearsals began to-day,&rdquo; he said. He sat down on the bed and looked very
      sombre. &ldquo;The worst possible has happened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fagan's directing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to console him. Perhaps I felt that if Upton had shown such good
      sense in his choice of a press representative his judgment in directors
      couldn't be altogether wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if the play's as good as you say, he can't hurt it
      much. Upton believes in it, he won't let Fagan chop it about, will he? And
      he's got a good cast&mdash;they won't need much direction: they know how
      to handle that kind of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's plain you don't know the game,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If Upton had combed
      Broadway from Herald Square to Reisenweber's, he couldn't have found a man
      so superbly equipped to kill the piece. As for poor Sampson, God help him.
      Fagan is a typical Broadway hanger-on, with plenty of debased cunning of
      his own; not a fool at all; but the last man for this kind of show, which
      needs imagination, atmosphere, delicate tone and tempo. But that's not all
      of it. Fagan hates me personally. He'll get me out of the company if he
      possibly can. He can do it, of course: he has Upton's ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat a moment, one eyebrow twitching nervously. Suddenly he cried out,
      in a quivering, passionate voice which horrified and frightened me: &ldquo;I've
      <i>got</i> to play Dunbar! It's my only chance. <i>Everything</i> depends
      upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such an outcry, in a man usually so trained a master of himself, was
      pitiful. I was truly shocked, and yet I was almost on the verge of nervous
      laughter, I remember, when the idiotic old spinster in the next room
      pounded lustily on the wall. I suppose she thought we were revelling. I
      could see that he needed to talk. I tried to soothe him with some
      commonplace words and a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know what I'm talking about. Fagan hates me. No need to
      go into details. He directed 'After Dinner,' you know&mdash;and massacred
      it. We had a row then... he tried to bully a girl in the company... I
      threatened to thrash him. He hasn't forgotten, of course. He passed the
      word round then that I ruined the show. If this were any other play I'd
      have walked out as soon as I saw him. But this piece is different. I&mdash;I've
      set my heart on it. My God, I'm just <i>meant</i> for that part&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the hope of calming him, I asked what had happened at the first
      rehearsal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the usual thing. We went through the first act, with the sides. I
      knew my lines perfectly, the only one who did (I ought to, I've been over
      them incessantly these few weeks&mdash;the thing haunts me). That seemed
      to annoy Fagan. Sampson was there&mdash;a quiet little man with a bright,
      thoughtful eye. For his benefit, evidently, Fagan got off his old tosh
      about Victor Hugo and the preface to 'Hernani'. It's a bit of patter he
      picked up somewhere, and uses to impress people with. In the middle of it,
      he suddenly realized that I had heard it all before. That made him mad. So
      he cut it short, and reasserted himself by saying that the first act would
      have to be cut a great deal. Sampson looked pretty groggy, but said
      nothing. Sampson, I can see, is my only hope. Fagan will try to force me
      out of the show by hounding me until I lose my temper and quit. He began
      by telling me how to cross the stage. A man who learned the business under
      Frank Benson doesn't need to be taught how to walk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ventured some mild sedative opinion, because I saw it did him good to
      pour out his perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how the actor is at the mercy of the director.
      The director is appointed by the manager and is responsible only to him.
      If the director takes a dislike to one of the cast, he can tell the
      manager he 'can't work with him', and get him fired that way; or he can
      make the man's position impossible by ridicule and perpetual criticism at
      rehearsals. He remarked to-day that I was miscast. The fool! I've never
      had such a part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, we talked until after midnight, and only stopped then because I was
      afraid that the spinster might begin to hammer again. In the end I got him
      fairly well pacified. He was delighted when I told him that I was going to
      be press agent, and I pleased him by making some memoranda of his previous
      career, which I thought I could work up into a Sunday story. To tell the
      truth, I did not, then, take all his distress at its face value. I knew he
      had had a difficult summer, and was in a nervous, high-strung state. I
      thought that his trouble was partly what we call &ldquo;actors' disease,&rdquo; or (to
      put it more humanely) oversensitized selfconsciousness. I promised to get
      round to the rehearsal the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, it was several days before I was able to attend a
      rehearsal. For the next morning Upton asked me to go to Atlantic City,
      where he had a musical show opening, to collect data for publicity. His
      regular press man was ill, and it was evident that he expected me to do
      plenty of work for my hundred a week. However, it was a new and amusing
      job, and I was keen to absorb as much local colour as possible. I went to
      Atlantic City on the train with the &ldquo;Jazz You Like It&rdquo; company, took notes
      of all their life histories, went in swimming with the Blandishing Blondes
      quartette that afternoon, had them photographed on the sand, took care to
      see that they were arrested in their one-piece suits, bailed them out, and
      by dinner-time had collected enough material to fill the trashiest Sunday
      paper. In the evening the show opened, and I saw what seemed to me the
      most appallingly vulgar and brutally silly spectacle that had ever
      disgraced a stage. I wondered how a company of quite intelligent and
      amusing people could ever have been drilled into such laborious and
      glittering stupidity. The gallery fell for the Blondes, but the rest of
      the house suffered for the most part in silence, and I expected to see
      Upton crushed to earth. When I met him in the lobby afterward I was
      wondering how to condole with him. To my surprise he was radiant. &ldquo;Well, I
      guess we've got a knockout,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This'll sell to the roof on
      Broadway.&rdquo; He was right, too. Well, this is out of the story. I simply
      wanted to explain that I was away from New York for several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got back to Upton's office I was busy most of the day sending out
      stuff to the papers. Then I asked the imperial young lady who was
      alternately typing letters and attending to the little telephone
      switchboard, where &ldquo;Obedience&rdquo; was rehearsing. At the Stratford, she
      replied. Wondering how many of Mr. Upton's amusing and discreditable
      problems were bestowed under her magnificent rippling coiffure (she was
      really a stunning creature), I went round to that theatre. The middle door
      was open and I slipped in. The house was dark, on the tall, naked stage
      the rehearsal was proceeding. It was my first experience of this sort of
      thing, and I found it extremely interesting. The stage was set out with
      chairs to indicate exits and essentials of furniture; at the back hung a
      huge canvas sea-scene, used in some revue that had opened at the Stratford
      the night before. The electricians were tinkering with their illuminating
      effects, great blazes and shafts of light criss-crossed about the place as
      the rehearsal went on, much to the annoyance of the actors. Little
      electric stars winked in the painted sky portion of the blue back-drop,
      and men in overalls walked about gazing at their tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down quietly in the gloom, about halfway down the middle aisle. Two
      or three other people, whose identity I could not conjecture, sat singly
      down toward the front. In the orchestra row, in shirtsleeves, with his
      feet on the brass rail and a cigar in his mouth, sat a person who, I saw,
      must be the renowned Fagan. Downstage were Brooks, Edwards, and a charming
      creature in summery costume who was obviously the original of the
      multitudinous photographs of Lillian Llewellyn. The rest of the company
      were sitting about at the back, off the scene. Edwards, who was very pale
      in the violent downpour of a huge bulb hanging from a wire just overhead,
      was speaking as I took my seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, folks&mdash;<i>wait a minute!</i>&rdquo; cried Fagan, sharply.
      &ldquo;Now! You've got your situation planted, let's nail it to the cross. Mr.
      Edwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actors turned, wearily, and Miss Llewellyn sat down on a chair. Brooks
      stood waiting with a kind of dogged endurance. At the back of the stage a
      workman was hammering on a piece of metal. Fagan pulled his legs off the
      rail and climbed halfway up the little steps leading from the orchestra
      pit to the proscenium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Edwards!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you're letting it drop. It's dead. Give it to
      Mr. Brooks so he can pick it up and do something with it. You've got to
      lift it into the domain of comedy! My God!&rdquo; he cried, throwing his cigar
      stub into the orchestra well, &ldquo;that whole act is terrible. Take it again
      from Miss Llewellyn's entrance. Mr. Edwards, try to put a little more
      stuff into it. This isn't amateur theatricals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwards turned as though about to speak, but he clenched his fist and kept
      silent. Brooks, however, was less patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Fagan,&rdquo; he said, in a clear, ironical tone. &ldquo;But I should
      like to ask a question, if you will allow me. You speak, very forcibly, of
      lifting it into the domain of comedy. That seems a curious phrase for this
      scene. Is it intended to be comic? If so, I must have misconstrued the
      author's directions in the script.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brooks was too well-known a performer for Fagan to bully. Brooks was &ldquo;on
      the lights&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, when the show's electric signboard went
      up, it would carry his name. Around his presence hung the mystic aura of
      five hundred dollars a week, quite enough in itself to make Fagan
      respectful. The director seemed a little startled by the star's caustic
      accent. As a matter of fact, I don't suppose he had ever read the script
      as a whole. I remembered that after the first rehearsal Edwards told me
      that Fagan had admitted not having read the play. He said he preferred to
      &ldquo;pick up the dialogue as they went along&rdquo;. This reference to the author
      must have seemed to him unaccountably eccentric. I daresay he had
      forgotten that there was such a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw up his hands in mock surrender. &ldquo;All right, all right, if that's
      the way you take it, I've got nothing to say. Play it your own way, folks.
      Mr. Edwards, you're killing Mr. Brooks's scene there. Give him time to
      come down and get his effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I saw Edwards lift his head as though about to retort, but Brooks
      whispered something to him. Fagan came back to his seat in the front row
      and lit a fresh cigar. &ldquo;Take it from Miss Llewellyn's first entrance,&rdquo; he
      shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cunningham and a third man came forward and the five regrouped
      themselves. The rehearsal resumed. I watched with a curious tingle of
      excitement. The dialogue meant little to me, plunging in at the middle of
      the act, but I could not miss the passionate quality of Edwards's playing.
      Even Brooks, a polished but very cold actor, caught the warmth. Their
      speeches had the rich vibrance of anger. I was really startled at the
      power and velocity of the performance, considering that they had only
      rehearsed a week. As I watched, someone leaned over my shoulder from
      behind and whispered: &ldquo;What do you think of Dunbar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My eyes had grown accustomed to the gloom. I turned and saw a little man
      with a thin face and lifted eyebrows which gave him a quaint expression of
      perpetual surprise. I was so absorbed in the scene that at first I hardly
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunbar&mdash;? Oh, Edwards?&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I think he's corking&mdash;fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Edwards was in the middle of a speech. Miss Cunningham had
      just said something. Edwards, going toward her, had put his hand on her
      shoulder and was replying in a tone of peculiar tenderness. Fagan's loud
      voice broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunbar! Mr. Edwards! I can't let you do it like that. You make me hold up
      this scene every time. Now get it right. This is a bit of comedy, not sob
      stuff. Try to be a bit facetious, if you can. You're not making love to
      the girl&mdash;not yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of silence. Those on the stage stood still, oddly like
      children halted in the middle of a game. I don't suppose Fagan's words
      were deliberately intended as a personal insult, but seemed to himself a
      legitimate comment on the action of the piece. I think his offences came
      more often from boorish obtuseness than calculated malice. But the brutal
      interruption, coming after a long and difficult afternoon, strained the
      players' nerves to snapping. Brooks sat down with an air of calculated
      nonchalance and took out a cigarette. Then a tinkling hammering began
      again somewhere up in the flies. Edwards was flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake stop that infernal racket up there,&rdquo; he cried. Then,
      coming down to the unlit gutter of footlights, he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fagan, I've studied this part rather more carefully than you have. If
      the author is in the house, I'd like to appeal to him as to whether my
      conception is correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was such a quiver of passion in his voice that even Fagan seemed
      taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's got into you folks to-day?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Oh, very well. Is Mr.
      Sampson here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man behind me got up and walked down the aisle in an
      embarrassed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Author,&rdquo; said Fagan, &ldquo;have you been watching the rehearsal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sampson murmured something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Edwards doing the part as you want it done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Edwards is perfectly right,&rdquo; said Sampson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Edwards from the stage. &ldquo;Fagan, when you are ready
      to conduct rehearsals like a gentleman, I will be here.&rdquo; He turned and
      walked off the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brooks snapped his cigarette case to, and the sharp click seemed to bring
      the scene to an end. Fagan picked up his coat from the seat beside him.
      &ldquo;Bolshevism!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All right, folks, ten o'clock to-morrow, here.
      Miss Cunningham, will you tell Mr. Edwards ten o'clock tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last might be taken either as a surly apology, or as an added insult.
      Rather subtle for Fagan, I thought. As I was getting out of my seat, the
      director and a venomous-looking young man whom I had seen in and out of
      Upton's office walked up the aisle together. Sampson was just behind them.
      I could see that the director was either furiously angry, or else (more
      likely) deemed it his duty to pretend to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This show's no good as long as Edwards is in it,&rdquo; he said, loudly,
      spitting out fragments of cigar-wrapper. &ldquo;That fellow's breaking up the
      company. I sha'n't be able to handle 'em at all, pretty soon. This kind of
      thing puts an omen on a show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was my introduction to &ldquo;Obedience&rdquo;. I watched Fagan and the
      hanger-on of Upton's office&mdash;one of those innumerable black-haired
      young infidels who run errands for a man like Upton, hobnob with the
      ticket speculators in the enigmatic argot of the box office, and seem to
      look out upon the world from behind a little grill of brass railings. They
      moved up the velvet slope of the passage, arguing hoarsely. Sampson faded
      gently away into the darkness and disappeared through the thick blue
      curtains of the foyer. An idea struck me, and I ran behind to see the
      stage manager, Cervaux, who was playing one of the minor parts. I cajoled
      his own copy of the script away from him, promising to return it to the
      office the next morning. I wanted to read the play entire. Going out
      toward the stage door, behind a big flat of scenery I came upon Miss
      Cunningham. She was sitting in a rolling chair, one of those things you
      see on the boardwalk at Atlantic City. There was a whole fleet of them
      drawn up in the wings, they were used in that idiotic revue playing at the
      Stratford. It added to the curiously unreal atmosphere of the occasion to
      see her crouching there, crying, alone in the half light, among those
      absurd vehicles of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intended to pass as though I hadn't seen her, but she called out to me.
      If Upton could have seen her then, her honey-brown eyes glazed with tears,
      black rings in her poor little pale face, he would have raised her salary&mdash;or
      else fired her, I don't know which.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Roberts,&rdquo; she said, slowly and tremulously&mdash;&ldquo;I don't know who
      else to ask. Will you try to help Morgan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why of course,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Anything I can do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were at the rehearsal? Then you saw how Fagan treats him. It's been
      like that every day. The brute! It's abominable! You know how we had set
      our hearts on playing this together, Morgan and I.... Now I've almost come
      to pray that Morgan will throw it up. That's what Fagan wants, of course,
      but I don't care. All I want is his happiness. I said something to him
      about giving up the part, but he... Mr. Roberts, I'm <i>worried</i>. I've
      never seen Morgan so strange before. He's not himself. I don't know what's
      the matter, I have a feeling that something&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The electricians were still fooling about with their spotlights, and a
      great arrow of brilliance sliced across the stage and groped about us. It
      blazed brutally upon her tear-stained face, and then see-sawed among the
      little flock of rolling chairs. It was that shaft of light that dispelled,
      once for all, the feeling I had had that this was all some sort of
      theatrical gibberish, pantomime stuff intended to impress the greenhorn
      press agent. For when she recoiled under the blow of that sudden stroke of
      brightness I could read unquestionable trouble on her face. There was not
      only perplexity, there was fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, turning her face away. Then she stepped down from the
      chair, in a blind sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begged him to give it up,&rdquo; she said, quietly. &ldquo;He said that no one but
      the author could take him out of this part. I wish the author would.&mdash;Oh,
      I don't know what to wish! Morgan's making himself ill fighting against
      Fagan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked across Fortieth Street together, and I escorted her as far as a
      Fifth Avenue bus. As we waited for the bus she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll probably see him to-night. Tell him about rehearsal to-morrow, ten
      o'clock. He had gone before I could speak to him. You see, he's not
      himself. We were to have taken supper together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She added something that I have never forgotten:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst tragedy in the world is when lovely things get in the hands of
      people who don't understand them. If you see Mr. Sampson, you might tell
      him that. Some day he may write another play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I got up to Seventy-third Street I tapped at Edwards's door. He was
      at his table, writing. I had intended to ask him to take dinner with me,
      thinking that perhaps I could help him, but his manner showed plainly that
      he wanted to be alone. If I had been an old friend of his, perhaps I could
      have done something; but I did not feel I knew him well enough to force
      myself upon his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fagan sent you word, rehearsal to-morrow at ten,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It sounds to
      me like an apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were there to-day? You will understand a little, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that Fagan is a ruffian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fagan&mdash;Oh, I don't mean Fagan.&rdquo; He paused and looked at the wet
      point of his pen. &ldquo;I was just writing a note to Sampson,&rdquo; he said. He
      hesitated a moment, and then tore the written sheet across several times
      and dropped it in the basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can't appeal to Sampson again. I'll have to work
      it out myself.&mdash;Don't imagine I take Fagan too seriously. Fagan is
      only an accident. A tragic accident. That's part of my weird, as the
      Scotch say. I mean, you'll understand better about Dunbar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn't quite understand, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't let a man like Fagan stand between me and Dunbar,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;It's in the hands of the author now. You heard what he said. He put
      Dunbar into the play, he's the only one who can take him out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Upton broke the news to me that I was to go out as
      advance man. The opening was set for Providence, only ten days later.
      There was to be a two-weeks' tour of three-night engagements, and I had to
      arrange for the publicity, poster-printing, accommodations for the
      company, and so on. This did not appeal to me very strongly, but I
      scrambled together a lot of photographs, interviewed the cast as to their
      preferences in hotel rooms, and set off. I got back a week later. We were
      then only three days away from the opening. They were rehearsing with the
      sets, Upton's telephone blonde told me, and I hurried round to the
      Stratford to see how the scenic artist had done the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had just knocked off for lunch when I got there, and at the stage
      door I met Edwards coming out with Miss Cunningham. He looked very white
      and tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;just in time to have lunch with me! Come on, we'll go to
      Maxim's. I've still got some of Upton's expense money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to rush round to the modiste for a fitting,&rdquo; said Miss
      Cunningham. &ldquo;The gowns are just finished. You take Morgan and give him a
      good talking-to. He needs it.&rdquo; I did not quite understand the appeal in
      her eyes, but I saw that she wanted me to talk with Edwards alone. She
      went toward Bryant Park, and we turned down to Thirty-eighth. Edwards
      stood a moment at the corner looking after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia says I'm a fool,&rdquo; he said, wearily. &ldquo;I don't know: most of us are,
      one way or another.&mdash;You know I told you that I put my confidence in
      the author.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I myself heard Sampson say he thought you were
      corking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wonder if he's double-crossing me?&rdquo; said Edwards, slowly, as
      though to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, when I was coming down to rehearsal, there was a tie-up of
      some kind on the subway. The train stood still for a long time, and then
      the lights went out. We stayed in the dark for I don't know how long&mdash;everybody
      got nervous. It was pitch black, and awfully hot and stuffy. The women
      began to scream. I felt pretty queer myself&mdash;you know I haven't been
      well&mdash;and as we sat there I went off into a kind of doze or
      something. Then, just as everybody was on the edge of a panic, the lights
      came on and we went ahead. When we got to Times Square I think I must have
      been a bit off colour, for the damned rehearsal went out of my head
      entirely. Suddenly I realized I was in a drugstore drinking some headache
      fizz when I was over an hour late at the theatre. My God! I hustled down
      there as fast as I could go. Queer thing. I went in through the stage
      door, and as I came round behind the set I heard voices on the stage. They
      were rehearsing, of course. Naturally, they couldn't wait all morning for
      me. But this is what I'm getting at. You know that scene in the second act
      where I say to Brooks: <i>It's all very well for you to say that. Ah, hah!
      I see! But suppose you had been in my place&mdash;-</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that's a turning point in the act. There's a particular
      inflection I give that speech&mdash;the way I say the 'Ah, hah! I see!'
      that makes the point clear to the audience and gets it over. Well, they
      were rehearsing that scene, and from behind the canvas I heard that
      speech. And what I heard was my own voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. He was sitting, his lunch almost untasted, with one elbow on
      the table and his forehead leaning on his hand. Under his long, sinewy
      fingers I could see his brows tightened and frowning downward upon his
      plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I say. It was my own voice. Or, if you prefer, Dunbar's
      voice. I heard that speech uttered, tone for tone, as I had been saying
      it. It was the precise accent and pitch of ironical comment which I had
      thought appropriate for Dunbar at that point in the action. The sudden
      change of tone, the pause, the placing of the emphasis&mdash;the words
      were just as if they had come out of my own mouth. I stopped,
      instinctively. I said to myself, has Fagan got someone else to play the
      part, and been coaching him on the side? Someone who's been sitting in at
      rehearsals and has picked up my conception of Dunbar? And at that moment I
      heard Fagan sing out 'All right, folks, the carpenter wants to work on
      this set. We'll quit until after lunch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I was staggered. If I was out, I was out, but they might have
      been straight with me. It was a matter for the Equity, I thought. I didn't
      want to chin it over with the others just then, and I heard them coming
      off, so I slipped through the door that opens into the passage behind the
      stage box. I meant to tell Fagan what I thought about it. There was
      Sampson sitting in one of the boxes. He saw me, and got up. He said: 'By
      Jove, Mr. Edwards, you were fine this morning. I've never seen you do it
      so well. It was bully, all through. Keep it like that, and you're the hit
      of the play.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought at first he was making fun of me. I was about to make some
      sarcastic retort, when he put out his hand in the friendliest way, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I want to thank you for what you're doing for that part, and I know it
      hasn't been easy. I've never seen anything so beautifully done, and just
      want to tell you that if the play is a success it will be largely due to
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, on the heels of the other, astounded me so that I didn't know what
      to say. I made some automatic reply, and he left. I sat down in the cool
      darkness of the box to rest, for I was feeling very seedy. My head went
      round and round&mdash;touch of the sun, I dare say, or that foul air in
      the crowded subway car. I was still there when they came back, an hour
      later, for the afternoon rehearsal. I tried to talk to Sylvia about it,
      but all she would say was that I ought to go to a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she's right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Look here, have you had any sleep lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have forgotten Dunbar's line,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;'<i>There'll be
      'plenty of time to sleep by and bye.</i>'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake forget about Dunbar,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Man, dear, you're on the
      tip of a nervous breakdown. Now listen. This is Friday. Dress rehearsal
      to-morrow. Sunday you'll have all day off. Take Miss Cunningham and go
      away into the country somewhere and rest. Put the damned play out of your
      mind and give her a good time. You both need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn't see him again until Monday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to Providence on the train with the company. As I passed through
      one of the Pullmans looking for a seat in a smoking compartment, I found
      Miss Cunningham and Edwards sitting in adjoining chairs. To my delight,
      they seemed very cheerful, and smiled up at me charmingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took your advice yesterday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We went down to Long Beach again.
      Had a lovely day, not even a pickpocket to spoil it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an unfortunate remark!&rdquo; said Sylvia, laughing. &ldquo;He means, not a
      pickpocket to bring us a friend in need and give us a jolly evening in
      Jamaica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke the speech trippingly,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we left Dunbar behind!&rdquo; said Sylvia. She flashed me a grateful little
      look that showed she knew I had tried to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you decided where to spend the honeymoon?&rdquo; I asked, greatly pleased
      to see them so happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We'll wait till we see what sort of notices the show
      gets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the poor press agent. I've used up all my dope. Get spliced
      while we're in Providence and it'll give me a nice little story. You know
      the kind of thing&mdash;'<i>Critics' Praise Brings Pair to Altar; Press
      Clippings Cupid's Aid</i>'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're getting as vulgar as a regular press agent,&rdquo; she said, merrily.
      &ldquo;They don't think of anything except in terms of good stories for the
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the press agent has his tragedies, too. Think how many
      stories he knows that he can't tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt that this remark was not very happily inspired, and went on through
      the car calling myself a clumsy idiot. In the smoking compartment, as luck
      would have it, were both Upton and Fagan, smoking huge cigars and talking
      together. I sat down and lit my pipe. Fagan, in his usual way, was trying
      to impress Upton with his own sagacity. There was another musical horror
      of Upton's scheduled to begin rehearsal shortly, and probably Fagan was
      hoping to land the job as director.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of Edwards at the dress rehearsal?&rdquo; said Fagan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton grunted. He had a way of retaining his ideas until others had
      committed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been telling you right along, he's impossible,&rdquo; said Fagan. &ldquo;No one
      can work with him. He's too damned upstage. Now I got Billy Mitford to
      promise he'd run up and see the opening. Billy is the man you need for
      that part. I had him in at the dress, and he'll be there tonight. I've
      given him a line on the part, and if Edwards falls down we can start
      rehearsing Billy right away. He could get set in a week, and open with the
      show in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred a week,&rdquo; was Upton's comment, seemingly addressed to the end
      of his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, he's worth it. He's got a following. This guy Edwards is dear
      at any price. He'll kill the show. He doesn't get his stuff over. God
      knows I've worked on him. And he crabs Brooks's work more'n half the time.
      What you want is one of these birds that gets the women climbing over the
      orchestra rail. Billy is your one best bet, take it from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll open her up and see what we got,&rdquo; said Upton. &ldquo;Is Sampson
      along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Scared. Said he was too nervous to come. He'll learn to write a play
      afterwhile. What a mess that script was until I got her straightened out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we got to Providence I had several jobs to do around town. I visited
      the newspaper offices, stopped in at the theatre where the stage crew were
      busy unloading scenery, and when I returned to the hotel I lay down in my
      room and had a good nap, I was awakened late in the afternoon&mdash;about
      five o'clock, because I looked at my watch&mdash;by a knocking at the
      door. I got up and opened. It was Edwards. To my dismay, his cheerfulness
      had vanished. He had gone back to the old pallid and anxious mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nervous, old man?&rdquo; I said. When I had booked the rooms for the company I
      had arranged that he and I should be next door to each other, so that I
      could keep an eye on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm ill. Had another of those damned swimming spells
      in my head. Haven't got any brandy, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hadn't, but offered to go in search of some. He wouldn't let me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look here, I saw Mit-ford in the lobby just now.
      What the devil is he doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps there's some other show on,&rdquo; I suggested, miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you they were trying to double-cross me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know
      perfectly well what he's here for. Fagan is trying to razz me into a
      breakdown. Then he'll put Mitford in as Dunbar. But I tell you, I'll play
      this thing in spite of hell and high water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paced feverishly up and down, and I tried to ease his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, they sha'n't!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I'll put this thing up to the author.
      Where's Sampson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not here. For heaven's sake, man, don't get in a state. Everything's
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything's all right!&rdquo; he repeated, bitterly. &ldquo;Yes, everything's
      lovely. Let's 'lift it into the domain of comedy'. But if you see Fagan,
      tell him to keep away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to rest until dinner-time. I went into his room with him,
      made him lie down on the bed, rang for a bottle of ice water, and left him
      there. Then I went downstairs and wrote a couple of letters. I was just
      leaving the hotel when I met Fagan coming in. He stopped me to ask if I
      had taken care to put his name on the playbill as director. I had. If the
      show was a flop, I at least wanted his name attached as a participial
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wandered uneasily about the busy streets until theatre time. I couldn't
      have been more nervous if I had been going on the boards myself. I spent
      part of the time prowling about trying to see how much &ldquo;Obedience&rdquo; paper I
      could find on the billboards and in shop windows. I stopped in at a
      lunchroom and had some supper. The place reminded me of the little café in
      Jamaica where Sylvia and Edwards and I had eaten together.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mind was full of the picture of the two, and his face as he leaned
      across the table toward her. I thought that I had never seen a couple who
      so deserved happiness, or who had fought harder to earn it. What was the
      subtle appeal in this play that made it react so strangely upon him? The
      tragedy of Dunbar in the piece, the sacrifice of the poor, well-meaning
      fellow whose virtue always seemed to turn and rend him, did this echo some
      secret experience in his own life? I wondered whether an actor's career
      was really the gay business I had conceived it. It occurred to me that
      perhaps the actor's profession is doomed to suffering, because it takes
      the most dangerous explosives in life and plays with them. Love, ambition,
      jealousy, hatred, those are the things actors deal with. You can't play
      with those without one of them going off every now and then. They go off
      with a bang, and somebody gets hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I'm sentimental. I wanted those two to win out. It seemed to me
      that a defeat for their fine and honourable passion would be a defeat for
      Love everywhere, and for all who believe in the worthy aspirations of the
      heart. I don't suppose any press agent ever pondered more generous
      philosophies than I did that night, over my lunch-counter supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went so fast that it was after eight when I got to the theatre. I
      went in and took a seat in the last row. The house, to my surprise, was
      crowded. I could see Upton's big bald head, well down in front, beside a
      massively carved lady, all bust and beads, whom I supposed to be Mrs.
      Upton. The élite of Providence were out in force, for Brooks's name is
      always a drawing card. Some of them, I feared, were going to be
      disappointed. It is all very well to introduce a new Barrie or a new
      Pinero to the playgoing public, but you've got to remember that it is
      bound to be grievous for those who prefer the other sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain, of course, was late, and I gave a sigh of relief when I saw
      it go up. Edwards, waiting carefully for the hush, had the house with him
      in three speeches. I have never seen better work, before or since. It was
      noticeable that at his first exit he got a bigger hand than Brooks at his
      carefully prepared entrance. The only thing that seemed to me out of the
      way was his extreme pallor. The silly ass, I said to myself, he hasn't
      made himself up properly. Then it struck me that it was probably a sound
      touch of realism, for certainly Dunbar would not be described as a
      full-blooded creature. I had read the play carefully, and had seen it in
      rehearsal; but I had never known how much there was in it. Strangely
      enough, Edwards was the only one who showed no trace of nervousness. All
      the others, even Brooks, seemed unaccountably at a loss now and then,
      trampled on their lines, and smothered their points. At first the house
      was inclined to applaud, but as the action tightened, they hushed into the
      perfect and passionate silence that is the playwright's dream. There were
      six curtains at the end of the first act. I could tell by the tilt of old
      Upton's pink pate that he was in fine spirits. I looked about for Fagan in
      the lobby, as I was keen to see how he was taking it, but missed him in
      the arguing and shifting crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the third act was under way it was plain that we had a
      sure-fire success. Novice as I was, I could read the signs when I saw
      Upton scribbling telegrams at the box-office window in the second
      intermission, and observed the face of Mr. Mitford. The usual slips that
      always happen on first nights were there, of course. In the third act,
      when Edwards had to take Sylvia in his arms, she seemed to trip and almost
      fell; and I noticed that Brooks crossed the stage and helped her off,
      which was not in the script; but these things were not marked by most of
      the audience. Dunbar, you remember, makes his final exit several minutes
      before the end of the third act. When he went off there was a little stir
      among the audience&mdash;far more eloquent than applause would have been.
      That beautiful delineation of a blundering high-minded failure had made
      its appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Edwards's last exit I felt my way out, quietly, and went round
      through the street and up the alley to the stage door. I wanted to be the
      first to congratulate him on his splendid triumph. I did not want to break
      in too soon, so I waited near the door until I heard the crash of hands
      that followed the curtain. The canvas rose and fell repeatedly as the
      players took their calls, while the house shook with applause. From where
      I stood, by the switches and buttons on the control board, I could see
      them lined up in the orange glare of the gutter, bowing and smiling. There
      were cries of &ldquo;Dunbar! Dunbar!&rdquo; and a rumbling of feet in the gallery. It
      is the only time I have ever seen an audience crowd down the aisles and
      stand by the orchestra rail, applauding. Then I saw why they lingered.
      Edwards had not taken his call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain fell again, and Cervaux, the stage manager, came running off,
      the perspiration streaming down over his grease-paint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christ!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where's that fool Edwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the curtain finally shut off the house I could see the actors
      turn to each other as though in dismay. Miss Cunningham came off, and I
      ran to shake her hand. To my amazement she looked at me blankly, with a
      dreadful face, and sat down on a trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brooks strode across the stage. &ldquo;Where's Edwards?&rdquo; he shouted, angrily.
      &ldquo;Tell him to take this call with me, the house is crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the author?&rdquo; said someone. &ldquo;They want the author, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several hurried upstairs to the men's dressing rooms, and I followed. The
      door of number 3, on which Edwards's name was scrawled in chalk, stood
      open. Cervaux stood stupidly on the sill. The room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone,&rdquo; said Cervaux. &ldquo;What do you know about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We could still hear the tumult of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the curtain, Mr. Brooks,&rdquo; said Cervaux. &ldquo;Tell them he's ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked round number 3 dressing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a taxi standing outside the stage door. I don't know how it
      happened to be there, or who had ordered it, but I shouted to the driver
      and jumped in. I have a faint impression that just as the engine started
      Sylvia appeared at the door, with a cloak thrown over her stage gown, and
      cried something, but I am not sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to the hotel, the door of the room next to mine was locked, but
      the house detective got it open without any noise. There were two men in
      the room. In the far corner lay Fagan, unconscious, with a broken jaw, one
      arm hideously twisted under him, and a shattered water bottle beside his
      bloody head. Sprawled against the bed, kneeling, with his arms flung out
      across the counterpane, was Edwards.&mdash;The doctor said it was heart
      disease. He had been dead since six o'clock.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
